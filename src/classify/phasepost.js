// The centroid measurement classifier — the geometric reader.
//
// Classification is measurement, not choice. A cell is an address, read off a
// proposition's position in centroid space, never a token a reader emits. The
// control-flow router may be a reader emitting a route (a wrong route is cheap;
// no false fact enters the graph). The classifier may not: a wrong cell ships a
// typed edge the talker speaks and the fold cannot un-say. So the cell is not
// chosen — it is measured.
//
//   1. Embed the proposition (at the grain the centroids were built in).
//   2. Score the vector against the 27 centroids, partitioned into three bands.
//   3. Per band, argmax. Margin = own similarity − nearest competitor's.
//   4. Per band, commit if the margin clears a floor; else no-commit.
//   5. Demote DESERT / proven-empty cells — an argmax there is a misfire.
//   6. Confidence = margin × cell provenance.
//
// `embedder` is injected, never imported — the same discipline as the other
// pure modules. The classifier measures meaning ONLY in the space the centroids
// were built in. Under the hash embedder the query vector lives in spelling
// space; the cosine between a spelling-space vector and a MiniLM-space centroid
// measures nothing, so the classifier short-circuits to all-positions-no-commit.
// A verb classified by spelling is the hardcoded list with extra steps — the
// thing this design exists to avoid. No-commit is the honest output until
// MiniLM is the embedder and verified centroids are loaded.
