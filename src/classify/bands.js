// Grain bands — the three positions a phasepost fills, partitioned by operator.
//
// A complete SVO fills three positions at once: Ground, Figure, Pattern. The
// 27 phasepost cells partition cleanly by operator into these three bands; a
// proposition is embedded once and scored three times, once against each band,
// yielding three cells with three margins.
//
//   Ground  (NUL, INS)            →  6 cells   the terrain the clause rests on
//   Figure  (SEG, DEF, SIG, EVA)  → 12 cells   the act that stands out
//   Pattern (CON, SYN, REC)       →  9 cells   the relation across the field
//
// This is the SAME partition core/address.js infers from the operator
// (INS/NUL → Ground; CON/SYN/REC → Pattern; the rest → Figure), named here as
// the three reading positions the classifier measures against.
//
// These are the operator-GRAIN bands — the axis the 27 cells partition on. They are
// NOT the structural role positions in parse/positionElements, which read the clause
// by information structure (subject = given → Ground, object = new → Figure, verb =
// relation → Pattern). The two share these three names over two different axes; see
// docs/proposition-addressing.md ("Role positions are not the operator-grain bands").
