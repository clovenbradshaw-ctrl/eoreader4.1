// EO: SYN·INS(Field,Network → Entity, Composing,Making) — structure backend, graph retelling
// The structure backend — generation from the engine's OWN structure, no LLM, no network.
//
// Every other backend draws the reply from a language model. This one does not: it reads
// the grounded excerpts the surfer selected (the same "What you read:" block echo speaks
// from), PARSES them back into a concept graph, TRAVERSES that graph from its warmest hub,
// and REALISES the walk as surface text — concept → traverse → words → grammar, the
// embedder-free path (src/write/). Reference is resolved by inverse coref (a pronoun only
// where the reader's field resolves it back), and adjacent same-subject clauses are
// aggregated. It is honest about what it is: a structural RETELLING of what was read, not
// an answer drawn from a trained model. When there is no structure to speak from, it says so.
//
// This is the alt chat modality: select it to watch the engine generate from structure
// alone, with nothing distributional anywhere in the path.
