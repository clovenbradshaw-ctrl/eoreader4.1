// The prompt-assembly contract — what the talker is handed.
//
// THE HONEST FRAME (docs/subjective-frame.md). The talker is not told "HERE IS YOUR
// ANSWER", nor made to pretend it read a whole document. It is told the truth: it is the
// voice of a reader, and the verbatim lines below are what its reading of the source TURNED
// UP on this question. The epistemics are stated plainly as a reading result — "here is what
// I found when I read it" — not the vaguer "what comes to mind", so the talker knows exactly
// what the data is. There is exactly one channel — those found lines — and the boundary falls
// out of the honesty: what was found is not the whole source, so speaking past it is
// incoherent rather than forbidden, and an absence is voiced the way a person voices it
// ("I didn't find that in what I read"), never as a stiff refusal. Being plain about the data
// and voicing the gap naturally is what lets a small talker answer like itself — and still
// help past the gap — instead of the over-steered stiffness the old framing produced.
//
// What this REVERSES from the earlier (prompt-assembly.md) contract, per the
// June 20 correction and docs/subjective-frame.md:
//   §2 — the fold's ARROWS leave the prompt. A model reads a flat relational arrow as a
//        causal claim even when the edge encodes only adjacency (the post-hoc
//        fallacy); the arrows shipping today are degraded verb-fragments, noise
//        not spine. Relational structure now rides in span SELECTION and ORDER
//        (the grounder's job), never as arrows in the talker's input.
//   §3 — NO recognition. Orientation is filename · type · length only — never an
//        extracted title or author. A talker that knows it is reading a famous
//        book narrates the book it remembers, not the lines it read; this is the
//        exact leak the metamorphosis battery puts under test. The front matter
//        is still ANSWERABLE — a metadata question routes to a metadata answer
//        (turn/stages.js) — it is just no longer AMBIENT in a content turn.
//   §1 — stop calling the spans "memory." A reader read some lines; that framing
//        is what makes the boundary hold with no refusal instruction behind it.
//
// Structure stays in the grounder: in selection, in order (§3 below), and in the
// edge-grounding veto on the way back. `serializeNotes` / the substrate stay
// alive — they feed the grounder and the veto — they just never reach the talker.
//
// The system message carries the stable boundary + voice (prefix cache holds);
// the per-turn user block carries the lines, the conversation so far, the
// question, and the absence clause last, where a small model attends hardest.

// The verbatim lines the reading turned up sit under this header — what the engine found
// on this question when it read the source. Named as a reading RESULT, not a vague "what
// comes to mind": the epistemics are plain about what the data is (lines that were read),
// which is what lets the talker answer like itself instead of narrating a memory. Exported
// so the echo backend (and pleias's RAG re-extraction) can find them. Recognition-free, and
// in the reader's register — never "excerpts from the document."
export const EXCERPTS_HEADER = 'What I found reading it:';

// NO default length prescription. The earlier contract carried a sentence cap, which
// a small model read as the TASK, not a ceiling — "summarize" came back as a literal
// three-sentence stub. The real bound is max_tokens, set per task by the intent pass
// (turn/intent.js). The empty budget means "say nothing about length"; a caller may
// still pass an explicit { sentences } / { chars } budget to re-impose a cap for one
// turn. See docs/prompt-assembly.md.

// "here is what I found when I read it," stated as a reading result, not the vaguer "what comes

// answer like itself: an over-steered frame ("that didn't come to mind", "the reading doesn't
// say") made a small model answer more stiffly than it naturally would. So the boundary is still
// there — what was found is not the whole source — but it is voiced as a person would ("I didn't
// find that in what I read"), and the talker keeps its freedom to help past the gap. The voice is

// reply is shaped — its brief (app.dc.js _steerLine) says "let it decide what you foreground
// AND how you shape the reply". Shape is now emergent from that invisible read, not forced by
// a template the talker parrots: the metacognition does the steering. See _steerLine for the

// The first cut handed the talker two LITERAL attribution templates — "the source notes…",

// answer opened "The source notes that…", then padded with "(the source notes…)" asides, and
// echoed the prompt's own framing labels ("What it means") back as headings. The register reads
// robotic. So this asks for the SAME librarian posture but in natural, varied prose: attribute
// when it matters, in your own words, without a recurring crutch phrase or parenthetical aside,
// and answer the question directly rather than narrating the act of reading.
//

// "Dolphins give each other hugs" / "Pods of bottlenose dolphins", quoted from nothing). So the
