// EO: EVA·DEF·REC(Network,Link → Lens, Binding,Tracing) — decideBind — the bind decision
// frame/bind.js — decideBind: the one bind, generalized from frame-binding-route
// Phase 3's single-frame couplings to the whole active path (docs/frame-holon.md).
//
// With a stack there is one coupling PER NODE on the active path, plus the
// novelty channel, each NUL-gated, argmax:
//
//   c_leaf        EVA(e | current leaf)         → REC-refine   (repair/continue this frame)
//   c_subj[i]     EVA(e | subject_i of leaf)    → REC-elaborate (same subject, asked/developed)
//   c_anc[k]      EVA(e | ancestor frame k)     → REC-return    (pop the digression: "where were we")
//   c_new         novelty(e)                    → SEG a child   (push: digression / decomposition)
//   (all under NUL)                             → hold to the incumbent leaf
//
// Every coupling is EVA over PROPS (the floor of meaning), measured by the
// CALLER in its own term-space (lexical Born overlap for text, set/prefix
// overlap for notes, feature overlap for patches) and handed in as numbers — so
// this decision is interior and identical across modalities: it never sees a
// unit, only couplings. The relaxation is the incumbent-as-resting-potential one
// already in longgen/relax.js: a push (SEG a child) or a pop (REC to an
// ancestor) must OUT-COMPETE the current leaf's refine through lateral
// inhibition, not merely register. Ties hold to the incumbent (the leaf channel
// is first in the alphabet).
//
// "Continue this frame · return to a level · revise a frame" is not new
// machinery — it is DEF·EVA·REC, the core's existing loop, at the frame grain:
// hold is DEF (and NUL when nothing coheres), a refine is EVA reinforcing the
// frame, a return is REC reinstating a suspended one, a push is SEG opening a
// child. Termination is the shared guards (frame/constants.js) reused
// unchanged: a push past MAX_DEPTH or MAX_FANOUT degrades to a refine and the
// firing is returned as `guard` so the caller records it in `dropped` — never
// silent. The control is one measurement over logged objects, so it can neither
// out-vote itself nor fail to halt.

//   novelty    c_new:  novelty(e), a number.
//   nul        the NUL line (core/voidnull's derived floor, or a caller
//              constant): a coupling must EXCEED it to enter the competition.
//   depth      the leaf's depth (defaults to path.length - 1) — the push guard.

//   elaborate target = leaf, subject = the winning subject.
