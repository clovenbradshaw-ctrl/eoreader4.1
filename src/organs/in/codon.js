// The codon adapter — meaning from a raw DNA/RNA reading frame, with NO genetics.
//
// The frequency adapter removed music theory and handed the engine bare Hz; octave
// equivalence then had to be DISCOVERED from shared overtones. This adapter does the
// same one step lower, on the genetic code. The only input is a list of codons —
// bare triplets over a 4-letter alphabet (A,C,G,U/T). Nothing is told to the engine:
// not the codon table, not which codons are synonymous, not that the third base is
// the redundant ("wobble") one, not even that there ARE amino acids. Every codon is
// its own entity. If two codons turn out to be "the same" — to belong to one family —
// the engine has to find that itself.
//
// The one structural fact we use is not biology, it is what a codon physically IS: a
// sequence READ in order, 5'→3'. So a codon's tokens are its PREFIXES — the first
// base, the first two, the whole triplet — exactly the way a tone's tokens were its
// overtones nesting on the fundamental. The first base is the fundamental: it is in
// every prefix and so weighs most; the third base appears in one prefix only and so
// weighs least. That weighting is not a prior about genetics — it is just reading
// order, the same left-to-right the engine reads a sentence in. Two codons' relatedness
// is then nothing but SHARED PREFIXES, measured by the engine's OWN Level-1 existence
// reading — `hits / qLen` over token sets (retrieve/lexical.js). The same set-overlap
// that runs over the words of a sentence, run over the prefixes of a codon, recovers
// the block structure of the genetic code with no codon table in sight.
