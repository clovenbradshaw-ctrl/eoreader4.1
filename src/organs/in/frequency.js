// The frequency adapter — meaning from raw Hz, with NO music theory at all.
//
// The music adapter still carried one prior: it keyed notes by pitch class
// (midi % 12), which bakes in octave equivalence and 12-tone equal temperament.
// This adapter removes it. The only input is a set of raw fundamental
// frequencies. Nothing is quantized to a scale, nothing is folded mod an octave,
// no interval is named, no ratio is privileged. Every note is its OWN entity —
// so if a note and the one at twice its frequency turn out to be "the same", the
// engine has to DISCOVER that, not be told it.
//
// The one physical fact we do use is not theory, it is what a vibrating string
// or column of air actually does: a tone is a fundamental plus overtones at
// integer multiples (f, 2f, 3f, …). We hand the engine each note's partials and
// stop. Octave equivalence and consonance are then nothing but SHARED OVERTONES
// — two tones an octave apart share half their partials, a fifth shares a third
// of them, a tritone almost none (Helmholtz, 1863). That overlap is measured by
// the engine's OWN Level-1 existence reading — `hits / qLen` over token sets
// (retrieve/lexical.js) — with each note's "tokens" being its partials. The same
// set-overlap the engine runs over the words of a sentence, run over the
// overtones of a note, recovers the harmonic series with no scale in sight.

// regardless; the tolerance only forgives real-world detuning.
