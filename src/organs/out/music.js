// The mirror of organs/in/music (which raises a melody onto the spine as notes): this
// lowers a task leaf onto a stretch of melody. It exists to FALSIFY the claim that the
// task language is text-shaped — it is planned by the same `createTaskSpec` and run by
// the same `runTaskGraph` as an essay, differing only in its NATIVE UNIT. Where text
// budgets a leaf in tokens, music budgets it in BEATS, and the single-reach ceiling is
// a phrase, not a paragraph; an over-ceiling section splits into sub-phrases exactly as
// a long essay paragraph splits into parts.
//
// (The leaf's `directive` is still carried as a text instruction here — generalizing the
// directive to a non-text representation is the follow-up the design note flags; this
// slice proves the EXTENT/ORGAN dispatch, the seam the runner crosses.)

// decomposer must split it. `contextOf` is the advisory width in motifs.
// The same neutral arc verbs, lowered to MELODIC moves. open → state the motif,
// develop → vary and extend it, close → resolve to a cadence. This is what makes the
// directive modality-neutral: the IR names the move, the organ names the music.
