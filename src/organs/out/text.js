// abstract `extent` is read in this organ's native unit (TOKENS), and the render
// delegates to the caller's injected generator (the model call), the same contract
// `tasks/spec.js` has always used. The judging stays in the modality-blind enactor;
// this organ only renders, exactly as organs/out/speech does.

// LEAF_MAX_TOKENS played when it was a global. `contextOf` is the advisory retrieval
// width per leaf, in this organ's context unit (spans).
// The neutral arc verb each act lowers to in PROSE. A directive names a move (open /
// develop / close / …) on a role; the organ supplies the language. So the same neutral
// directive that music renders as a phrase, text renders as a sentence.
