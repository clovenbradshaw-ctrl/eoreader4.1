// The stance layer as a fold — recalibration as a REC in the log (prototype, flagged).
//
// THE SEAT this dissolves. The enacted loop rides a scale — "what counts as normal
// surprise for this reading" (the confirm band, the per-line step). Today that scale
// is set two ways, both OUTSIDE the log: hand-set constants (the k·step family), or
// the causal `recalibrate()` window in loop.js that refits band/step every cursor from
// a rolling `seen[]`. The refit is the reading's stance adapting — but by a mechanism
// that sits outside the enacted record: it cannot be replayed by the fold, and it
// cannot itself be RECed. A derived threshold (even the signal-from-noise one measured
// in docs/born-frame-measurement.md) is the same seat with better arithmetic, as long
// as it is computed by something the log does not contain.
//
// THE MOVE. Make the calibration an ENACTED act. A `stance` frame stands on the
// reading's current sense of normal — its band and step. Each cursor is an EVA of the
// incoming surprise against that normal; the departures accumulate as strain. When the
// accumulated drift beats what the reading's own surprise throws up by chance, the
// stance frame can no longer hold its normal and RECs: it installs a NEW normal as a
// DEF. Recalibration is then a REC in the log — replayable by `replayFrames` (which is
// already layer-agnostic), and revisable by the same operator the loop uses on a claim.
// REC applied to REC.
//
// THE BREAK RULE is signal-from-noise, NOT the Born partition. Step 0
// (docs/born-frame-measurement.md) measured that `offMass > onMass` does not track a
// frame break; the stance layer as literally specified in the directive inherited that
// rule and would inherit its negative. So the stance breaks by the criterion that DID
// measure sound: the drift beats the noise line derived from the stream's own spread.
//
// THE FOLD FALLS OUT FOR FREE. `replayFrames` reconstitutes any layer's frame by
// spreading `...e.frame` and accumulating `strainDelta` under the frame's leak. So if
// the stance DEF carries { band, step } and each stance EVA carries
// `strainDelta = (1−λ)·(surprise − band)` with the stance frame's leak = λ, the folded
// strain IS the EWMA drift of surprise from the stance's normal — the detector's own
// state, reconstituted by the existing fold with no new replay code. That is the
// directive's claim made literal: "replayFrames reconstitutes the calibration at any
// cursor with no new code, because it folds any layer generically."
