// resolution-spectrum.js — where a coreference/identity decision sits on the one
// axis that actually matters: DOES RESOLVING IT NEED THE WITNESS CHANNEL TO READ
// MEANING?
//
// The tempting axis is hand-coded-vs-learned. That is the wrong cut, and naming it
// that way reintroduces the very conflation this module exists to prevent: the
// engine's middle tier already contains a LEARNED-STATISTICAL layer — the
// Fellegi-Sunter m/u weights, discriminativeness (inverse value-frequency), the REC
// ledger's support/strain. Those are learned from the corpus, not hand-written, and
// they are emphatically NOT the model. The boundary is the WITNESS CHANNEL: a
// witness reads meaning (open-domain world-knowledge, physical reasoning, the
// trigger word's sense) and deposits defeasible weight into the field; it never
// decides. Everything reachable WITHOUT that channel — deterministic rules PLUS
// corpus-learned statistics — is one (correctly large) region; only what genuinely
// needs to read meaning crosses the line.
//
// So the axis is `needsWitness`, and the tier is a finer placement on it:
//
//   resolved — structure already settled it (a name alias, a clear field winner).
//   engine   — resolvable by deterministic rules + CORPUS-LEARNED STATISTICS, no
//              witness channel. The large middle. (Learned ≠ model.)
//   mixed    — straddles: a deterministic/learned core with a witness-needing tail
//              or sub-case. The straddle is itself the evidence the axis is real.
//   model    — needs the witness channel to read meaning. The genuine frontier.
//
// This module is a READER of decisions, not a maker of them: it emits nothing into
// the log, so it is parity-safe by construction, and it depends on nothing outside
// core. The conformance panel and the answer layer consult it to be honest about
// which abstentions are the next deterministic build and which actually justify the
// model.
