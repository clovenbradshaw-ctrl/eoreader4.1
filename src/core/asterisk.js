// core/asterisk.js — the ontological asterisk: identity held open as a question.
//
// projectGraph has one identity primitive and it is binary: find() puts two ids in
// the same cluster or it does not, and a SYN kind:'merge' collapses them at
// projection time with no record that the collapse was earned, attested, or merely
// guessed. There is no object for the state a reader is in most of the time — these
// two names look like one person and nothing has established that they are. The
// engine already carries a VOID as a first-class event; it is not yet honest about
// identity. The asterisk is the missing object.
//
//   A resolved individual is a Figure         tom-turner.1
//   A name shared across unlinked sources is   tom-turner*   — the relational space
//   across instances bearing that label, identity UNESTABLISHED. The asterisk is the
//   correct EO construal of an unresolved name, not a UI decoration bolted onto it.
//
// Disambiguation is the move from `*` toward Figure, and it has TWO legal outcomes,
// not one: resolve to a single Figure (merge earned) or fork into two Figures (split
// earned). The binder today only knows how to merge, so it rewards verbatim label
// echo over relational correspondence and never produces the split. This module is
// the relational test that replaces the echo.
//
// The disambiguation loop is DEF · EVA · REC run on identity instead of on a fact:
//   DEF  the terms — discriminators that travel with a person (employer, geography,
//        tenure, a co-attesting source). NOT the name; the name is the thing in
//        question and cannot also be the evidence.
//   EVA  test the two clusters against the terms. Each shared discriminator is a CON
//        edge; the merge is licensed by CONVERGENCE of CON edges, never by the label.
//        Conflicting discriminators are positive evidence of two people.
//   REC  restructure on the outcome: collapse `*` to one Figure (convergence), fork
//        it into two (conflict), or do nothing and let the identity void stand as a
//        finding — no source establishes whether these are the same person.
//
// This module is core: it depends on nothing outside core. The relation algebra
// (relation-types.js) is core; the perceiver's idFor is NOT imported — the one-line
// label normalization is duplicated below rather than reaching up into a faculty.
