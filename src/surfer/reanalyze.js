// Bond-level reanalysis — the garden-path recovery, as the engine's own loop one level down.
//
// Reading runs under the arrow of time, so it commits a bond before the evidence is in. In
// "Beauty ran past the barn fell" the reader commits "Beauty ran [fell]" — grabbing the verb
// "fell" into the object slot — and then "fell" turns out to be the main verb: the horse
// [that was] raced past the barn / FELL. Recovering that is REANALYSIS, and reanalysis is the
// same predict→error→reconsolidate loop the basis already runs (REC), applied to the
// syntactic bond. Nothing new is invented here; it COMPOSES pieces the engine already has:
//
//   • SURPRISAL (the trigger): a committed bond whose object slot holds a PREDICATE, not a
//     referent, is the prediction error — objects are not verbs. That anomaly is the spike.
//     (The "is it a verb" oracle is the corpus HOW-conventions / the ledger's isRelation —
//     the relation vocabulary, never any content.)
//   • CUE-BASED RE-RETRIEVAL (the search): the orphaned verb needs a subject, so we re-search
//     the entity field by γ-recency — the same kernel coref uses — for the most available
//     antecedent (Lewis & Vasishth: reanalysis is re-retrieval).
//   • RECONSOLIDATION (the commit): a REC event SUPERSEDES the mis-bond and FORMS the new one,
//     demoting the original verb to a modifier. Append-only — the mis-bond stays on the trail,
//     so the garden path is auditable: bond formed → contradicted → dissolved → recomposed.
//     (Memory reconsolidation: retrieval makes a bond labile, then it re-stabilises. The brain
//     does this destructively and so confabulates; the append-only log keeps the reaction
//     history, so the reanalysis can be watched, not lost.)
//
// reanalyze is a pure pass over a parsed doc — it returns the reconsolidation trail; it does
// not mutate the log. A caller may append the REC events to make the reanalysis part of the record.
