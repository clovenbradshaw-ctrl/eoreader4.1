// The surfer — a surfer with no pilot. (docs/surfing-the-fold.md)
//
// The fold used to read significance at one fixed cursor: the top retrieval hit.
// That is a router-style CHOICE, and a choice is the wrong category. The surfer
// replaces it. It does not ask where to look; it measures where the field is
// steepest and steps there. The field is the witness, the gradient is the verdict,
// the step is mechanical — the witness-does-not-decide rule applied to navigation.
//
// Three axes, three quantities the reading already maintains:
//
//   focus    the warmest figure (γ-mass argmax) — where the eye sits.
//   cursor   advance through the flat, arrest on the peaks of BAYESIAN surprise
//            (read/reading.js `bayes`), so it arrests where the reading was
//            REWRITTEN, not where a token merely looked odd (the TV-snow fix).
//   frame    a frame breaking under accumulated strain (a REC) is an arrest too —
//            the same DEF·EVA·REC loop the significance engine runs, calibrated to
//            the reach, so the cursor axis and the frame axis read the same scalar.
//
// Every move is a pure function of the log and the field: same document, same
// anchor, same path. The frame axis lives in the enact holon (loop.js, a leaf with
// no read dependency), so this import stays acyclic.
