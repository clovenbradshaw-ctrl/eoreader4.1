// The Stance face — how the surfer MOVES ρ (Track F), and the confabulation guard
// made quantitative.
//
// Tracks A–E read the Horizon ρ. This is the fourth surfer faculty: not where to look
// (the cursor), not which lens (Track C), but HOW TO UPDATE — the manner of the commit.
// The witness-does-not-decide rule says that manner has a measured-correct answer read
// off the field, never authored. It is the only faculty that closes the loop back onto
// ρ (core/spectral.js applyStance), so it is what makes the column a DYNAMICS rather
// than a sequence of readings.
//
// THE GUARD, MADE QUANTITATIVE (cube.md #1, #7). cube.md's predicted error is "Make
// where you should Cultivate or Clear" — a Figure fix on a Ground problem, the invented
// location ("the situation in the —" with a spurious place). In operator terms it is
// exact: minting a fake rank-1 eigen-lens when the honest move was to raise the floor
// (Cultivating — "I am less sure where this is", entropy up, no direction) or remove a
// component (Clearing — a defeat). updateStance reads the update stance off the field
// shape around the peak and REFUSES a Making the field does not support:
//
//   if a rank-1 component clears its spectral deriveNull   → Making     (commit a lens)
//   else if the field around the peak is measurably flat    → Cultivating (reserve, do not commit)
//   else                                                    → Clearing   (dephase; a real
//                                                                          surprise but no clean lens)
//   …route (op, site, stance) through cellAt — drop if the Object-diagonal guard rejects it.
//
// This is answerability (surfer/answerable.js fieldIsVoid — the refusal to Make where
// you should Clear) generalised from the binary void/not-void to the full nine-way
// stance read. The Ground-grain outcomes (Cultivating/Clearing) ARE the guard firing:
// the field supports only a Ground move, so a Figure commit would be the confabulation,
// and the talker must reserve rather than name a clause.
