// The enact holon — the enacted DEF–EVA–REC loop (the significance engine).
//
// Two loops, kept apart (§2, §10):
//
//   DEPICTED   classify/   a clause's phasepost perception — what a clause
//               reports — content, timeless, recomputable, tagged
//               `kind:'phasepost'`. NOT this holon.
//   ENACTED    this holon   the reading's own act of establishing terms (DEF),
//               testing particulars against them (EVA), and restructuring its
//               frame when the testing breaks it (REC) — temporal, ordered,
//               cross-layer, tagged `register:'enacted'`. The cognition.
//
// createEnactedLoop is pure on an injected `read(cursor) → { surprise, terms }`.
// enactedReadingTo wires it to the cheap γ-mass surprise that already runs over
// the whole document (read/readingAt), builds the enacted log once per doc in
// generation order, and folds it to a cursor — the mechanical skeleton the spec
// scopes for today, to be deepened with no shape change once the meaning reader is
// live (§11).

// The cheap surprise provider — now the BAYESIAN γ-mass surprise over the field
// (docs/bayesian-surprise.md), the only strain honestly computable until the meaning
// reader is live (§11). It rides `bayes` (the significance channel), not `surprise`
// (novelty), so a frame breaks on a genuine restructuring of the reading rather than
// on an inert improbability. The terms are the figures the reading predicts are in
// play at the cursor: a real, mechanical term-set the frame stands on, re-read
// whenever a frame is set, so a document frame (re-read only on its rare RECs) stays
// older and stickier than a proposition frame — which is why the same referent reads
// differently at two ages of the loop.

// Build the full enacted log for a doc once, in generation order, and cache it. The
// log is append-only and the arrow runs forward, so the whole-document log is the
// superset of every cursor's reading; the fold (replayFrames) reconstitutes any
// cursor from it. Same discipline as projectGraph's memo — keyed by the doc, which
// is immutable post-parse — so the loop is run once, not per cursor move.
//
// The readings drive the loop; the band + thresholds are now calibrated CAUSALLY,
// online inside the loop from the surprises seen so far (calibrate:'causal'), not
// from a median over the whole reading — the future no longer sets the band that
// judges an early line. `bayes` clusters far below the static band, so the causal
