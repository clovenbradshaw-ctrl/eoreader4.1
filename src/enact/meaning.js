// EO: SIG(Field → Atmosphere, Tracing) — meaning reader; 1-cos surprise
// The meaning reader — the richer `read` the skeleton was built to receive (§11).
//
// The enacted loop (loop.js) is unchanged. The skeleton fed it the cheap γ-mass
// surprise — modelless, thin, real but blind to meaning: it spikes when a new
// FIGURE arrives, and misses a topic or tone shift that introduces no new name.
// This deepens the surprise WITHOUT touching the loop, exactly as the design
// promised: "the same machinery deepens with no shape change — only a richer
// read." The frames, strain, REC, cross-layer testing, and the arrow of time are
// identical; only the per-cursor divergence is now measured in MEANING space.
//
// SURPRISE is the prediction error in the centroids' space: how far the clause
// sits from the γ-decayed semantic prior the reading carried into it. A clause
// that continues the current sense is near the prior (low surprise, the frame
// holds); a clause that turns the sense is far (high surprise, strain accrues
// toward a REC) — even when no new figure enters, which is the depth the γ-mass
// reader cannot see.
//
// THE FIREWALL. Meaning-distance is only real in the space the embedder measures.
// Under the hash organ a cosine is spelling, not meaning, so buildMeaningRead
// returns null and the caller falls back to the cheap reader — the same no-commit
// discipline the classifier runs. The meaning reader is honest only on MiniLM.
//
// TERMS stay the salient figures (the frame's human-readable label); the deepening
// is the surprise that DRIVES restructuring, not the labelling. Frames standing on
// semantic terrain rather than figure lists is a further step, noted in the doc.
//
// CONTRIB is the per-dimension axis the surprise strains ALONG — the same bayesBy the
// cheap path supplies. The meaning 1−cos says HOW FAR the sense moved (the magnitude
// that breaks the frame); bayesBy says along WHICH figures belief moved (the axis the
// REC restructures toward). Wiring it is what lets the deep reader restructure toward
// the cause of the break, not whatever figures were merely in view — the cheap path
// got this; the meaning path, the one that matters, had been left without it.

// Build the per-cursor meaning-distance surprise over a document's clauses, async.
// Returns { surprise, terms, contrib } ready to drive createEnactedLoop, or null when
// the embedder cannot measure meaning.
//
// CLAUSE GRAIN (clause-layer.js) — the depth the sentence pool erased. The surprise
// was measured over one pooled vector per whole SENTENCE, so a compound sentence whose
// second clause turned the sense had that turn averaged into its calm first clause and
// never broke a frame. We now γ-decay the prior and measure the 1−cos divergence over
// CLAUSES in reading order (a finer prior AND a finer divergence), then fold each
// sentence's clauses back to its cursor by MAX — the loud clause sets the sentence's
// surprise instead of being diluted by the quiet one. The enacted loop still steps by
// SENTENCE cursor (surprise.length === sentences.length), so nothing downstream changes.
// A document of simple single-clause sentences is byte-identical: one clause per
// sentence, max over one element, the same series as before.
