// The fold — replay the enacted events to a cursor and reconstitute the reader's
// frames as of that cursor.
//
// The reading at a cursor IS the cross-layer enacted loop replayed to that cursor
// and no further (§5, §7, §8). Fold to an earlier cursor and the frames are
// younger — they have survived fewer tests and absorbed less cross-layer strain,
// and may still hold terms a later particular will break. The baker and the
// unreliable narrator are the same referent under a document frame at two ages of
// the loop; the fold reconstitutes the frame as of the cursor by replaying the
// enacted loop to that point. This is the same fold-decides discipline as
// projectGraph: a pure function of (events, cursor), because the loop's generation
// order is all the fold needs — the order is the reading's arrow of time, and any
// sorted or grouped view would destroy exactly the temporal structure being read.
