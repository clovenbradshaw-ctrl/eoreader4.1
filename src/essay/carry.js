// essay/carry.js — the compressed state that crosses each doorway.
//
// Small by law: the carry is a CHUNK — the prior sections consolidated into
// one unit that costs one unit of budget in the next fold. It is never the
// text of prior sections (that lives only in the log); it is their compressed
// trace: the invariant thesis, the terminal claim of the last accepted
// section, the open threads (promises made, not yet paid), and the ledger of
// bound commitments for repeat and contradiction checks.
//
// Invariants enforced here:
//   - the thesis is COPIED, never rewritten, into every carry; it changes
//     only by replan (replanCarry is the single door).
//   - updateCarry closes paid threads, re-dates deferred ones, opens new
//     ones; a thread leaves the carry only by being paid.
//   - capCarry compresses old ledger entries to their contradiction-relevant
//     core (claim + section, spanRefs dropped) rather than forgetting them.
