// accumulates a self; project that departure to tokens through the eigen-lenses:
//
//   personality(token) = Σ_i (λ_i − 1/d) · ⟨lens_i | token⟩
//
// λ_i are ρ's Born weights (its eigenvalues), 1/d the maximally-mixed baseline in d
// dimensions, and ⟨lens_i | token⟩ the lens realised in token space through the bridge. The
// claim made mechanical: when ρ = σ every λ_i = 1/d, every coefficient (λ_i − 1/d) = 0, the
// bias is identically zero, and the voice is characterless by construction. A Horizon that
// has read and committed carries a standing tilt; resetState / a re-ground returns ρ → σ and
