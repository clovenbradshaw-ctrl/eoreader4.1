// EO: SEG·CON·INS(Field,Network → Network,Link, Dissecting,Binding,Making) — span->cell resolver (streaming answer §2)
// write/plan.js — the span→cell resolver: a surfer stop becomes a cursor cell.
// (The Streaming Answer §2, §7 Piece 1)
//
// The writer demo hand-specifies its cells; an answer must DERIVE them. The plan is
// not authored — it is read off the physics. `fold` (turn/stages.js) already runs
// the surfer over the retrieved subgraph and returns `surf = { stops, peak, focus,
// field, recCursors }`. The surfer steps down the Bayesian-surprise gradient and
// arrests where the reading was REWRITTEN, so its stops are exactly a beat order:
// EACH STOP IS ONE SENTENCE (§2). The same witness-does-not-decide rule the surfer
// obeys for navigation now obeys it for composition.
//
// `stopToCell` is the inverse of the reader's clause→event typing: take a stop and
// SELECT the graph edge to realise —
//   • the stop's focus figure              → the cell's SUBJECT (its integral name);
//   • the strongest edge leaving it within  → the cell's EDGE (A -> B : tends), its
//     the reach                               endpoints the Subject/Object slots;
//   • the edge's Resolution band            → the cell's BAND, so a void stop HEDGES
//                                             before it is written, never after (§3b);
//   • the spans the edge was read from       → the cell's grounded excerpts.
// A stop that carries no firm edge — pure significance with nothing to assert — is
// rendered as an ORIENTING beat (a free instruction), never forced into a claim
// (the §3b FIRM-ONLY law applied to the answer).
//
// This is the smallest new piece: it reads structures `fold` already computed.
// `figureSurface` (perceiver) already returns a referent's incident edges,
// coref-collapsed and WEIGHT-RANKED, in surface form (src/tgt labels, via, polarity,
// modality, idx) — so "the strongest edge leaving the figure" is read off it, not
// recomputed. The membrane (write/cursor.js) still asserts no hashId leaks.
