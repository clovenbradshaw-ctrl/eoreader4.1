// realize.js — grammatical encoding: the surface step that joins clauses.
//
// The plan gives propositions; refer.js resolves each one's referring forms (pronoun vs
// name, by inverse coref) and renders it as a standalone clause "Subj verb obj." That is
// correct but choppy — English does not say "He woke. He saw his legs. He turned." It says
// "He woke, saw his legs, and turned." Aggregation is the standard NLG move that earns the
// difference: when consecutive clauses share a subject, drop the repeated subject and
// conjoin the predicates. That is ALL this stage claims to do — it is grammatical surface
// work, not a second act of meaning.
//
// What it deliberately does NOT do (the leash): it does not re-inflect verbs — the plan's
// verbs arrive already inflected from the reading (woke, saw, brought), and re-inflecting
// would corrupt them. It does not invent determiners or prepositions it cannot justify from
// the plan. It does not re-decide reference — refer.js already did that as the discourse
// unfolded, and collapsing an adjacent same-subject clause is exactly the repetition that
// reference would have pronominalised anyway, so the collapse is safe. Provenance and the
// me-ness/self line are passed through untouched.
