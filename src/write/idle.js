// write/idle.js — the governed idle loop. (SPEC §15)
//
// The chatbot posture — inert until prompted — is a gate held shut, not the
// machine's nature. The preconditions for a self-running loop already exist: the
// efference copy means output re-enters as perceivable (enactor/efference.js); the
// self/world line gives a `me` channel (core/self, core/provenance.js §8); the
// surfer rides a field whether or not a question was asked. So IDLENESS is the
// suppression to justify, not continuity.
//
// But unstructured continuity is the architecture's own worst failure at full duty
// cycle: let the loop re-perceive its own output with noise and it RUMINATES — the
// efference copy re-enters, gets mistaken for signal, the surfer rides its own wake,
// REC fires on self-generated churn. That is noisy-TV fused with the sister/mother
// laundering bug, unsupervised. Continuity is legitimate ONLY because the §8 type
// law holds underneath it: every idle pass is provenance-tagged REAFFERENT and
// therefore barred from witnessing anything as world (canWitness === false). The
// type law is what licenses idling at all — which is why this module is HARD-GATED
// behind P6 (provenance), and why every candidate it emits is fromEnactor.
//
//   idle loop (governed, reafferent, firewalled):
//     while awake:
//       void  = pick an open Resolution        // seeded noise varies WHICH; never content
//       field = surf(void neighbourhood, against recently-ingested exafference)
//       if a fresh exafferent doc bears on void → emit CANDIDATE   // reafferent (§8)
//       if REC(field) < median band → quiesce   // converged for now
//     sleep until exafferent arrival → wake      // world wakes it, not a timer
//
//   I1 Anchor          — every idle pass is fed by exafference (an open void + recently
//                        ingested documents), never by self-output alone.
//   I2 Firewall        — idle output is reafferent by §8 type and CANNOT enter the
//                        witnessing set. Only a human confirm (the witness act) grounds.
//   I3 Self-terminating— the loop quiesces on the median band. It never spins.
//   I4 Wake on world   — exafferent arrival wakes it; idle is not a self-poll.
//   I5 Noise steers    — seeded randomness varies attention, not content.
//
// This is the deterministic ENGINE of the loop — no timers, no DOM, surf injected —
// so it is testable and the §16 product surface (idle-ux.html) is pure presentation
// over this state.
