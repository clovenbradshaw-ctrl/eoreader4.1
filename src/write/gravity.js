// EO: SYN·EVA·DEF(Network,Field → Network,Field,Lens, Composing,Tracing,Making) — weight of the turn; the arc broadcast
// write/gravity.js — the weight of the turn: the surf's discarded dynamics, broadcast.
// (docs/weight-of-the-turn.md)
//
// The surf computes a reading's DYNAMICS — where it arrested, where it was rewritten
// (the RECs), how much each stop matters to the live thread — and the write path kept
// almost none of it: stopToCell takes the node, not the movement between nodes, and the
// reader gets equally-weighted conclusions without the arriving-at. In the global-
// workspace sense that trajectory was computed and never broadcast. This module is the
// broadcast, in four coupled moves, each riding an organ that already exists:
//
//   1. arcGravity  — the brief widened from propositions to RELATIONS-BETWEEN: the
//                    trajectory's phases and turns (surfer/trajectory.js), lifted into a
//                    weighted payload a brief can carry.
//   2. speakArc    — the turn RENDERED as a turn ("at first…, then…"), the superseded
//                    reading carried forward as what the new one rose out of (a REC
//                    transcends and includes the bond it supersedes) — never flattened
//                    into juxtaposed equal claims.
//   3. connectiveLeash — every rendered connective is a CLAIMED edge at the discourse
//                    grain. A contrast ("but", "at first…then") claims a turn; a sequence
//                    ("then", "later") claims an order; a cause ("therefore") claims what
//                    an arc never holds. Each is licensed against the arc or flagged —
//                    the correspond.js discipline, one grain up.
//   4. turnWeights — gravity is not uniform heaviness. The rewrite magnitude at each REC
//                    (the surf field's own Bayesian surprise over its median) and the
//                    thread salience (the Born weight |⟨T|s⟩|², surfer/salience.js) set
//                    the DISTRIBUTION of emphasis: the heaviest form goes to the turn
//                    where the reading worked hardest; an off-thread relation is
//                    subordinated below the same noise null the surfer rides — marked,
//                    never erased.
//
// Everything here operates on graph and prose — no decode-time logits — so it runs on
// any backend. And the honest accounting stands in both directions: a rendered turn is a
// REPORTED reconsolidation, not a felt one; but because every form is read off the log
// (the recCursors are append-only supersessions, the weights are measured surprise), the
// system can only render a revision it genuinely underwent. Gravity that cannot earn
// itself decays to the flat surface — which is the correct failure.
