// EO: EVA·DEF·NUL(Network,Field → Lens,Paradigm, Binding,Tracing,Tending) — Map<Holder,Fold>; beliefOf/modelOf (§3,§9,§20)
// write/folds.js — Map<Holder, Fold>; beliefOf; modelOf. (SPEC §3, §9, §20)
//
// §1: the Given-Log is the only non-perspectival object. Everything else is a
// Horizon — a projection computed at read time from some holder's routed subset of
// the log. The instant a second mind exists in the content, the log stops having one
// fold over it and starts having a family, one per holder. This module is that family.
//
// Belief is a fold from a point of view, time-indexed by the cursor (§3):
//
//   beliefOf(holder, fact, t) = the latest value of `fact` among events that holder
//                               WITNESSED, up to t (null means no information: void —
//                               the holder does not know).
//
// Higher-order belief is a fold containing a model of another fold (§3):
//
//   modelOf(A, B, fact, t) = the latest value among events e (e ≤ t) where A witnessed
//                            e AND B witnessed e. Events where A saw B ABSENT do NOT
//                            update A's model of B — which is what produces correct
//                            second-order false belief (belief.mjs / §9).
//
// THE NESTED ROOT (Update 4, §20). The system never holds another holder's belief; it
// holds its belief ABOUT another's. So every value this module reports about a non-self
// holder is wrapped in the outer instrument root (core/holder.js): `beliefOf` returns a
// `modeledBy: instrument` Belief, and `modelOf(A,B)` is the convenience name for
// `instrument-models( A-models-B )` — the outer instrument root always present (§20b).
// That outer root is reafferent, so by the type law it cannot anchor (§20a): the §9
// honesty rule is a CONSEQUENCE here, not a separate guard.
//
// WITNESSING IS HAND-LABELLED HERE. Who-witnessed-what (and especially who was absent)
// is supplied per event. Reading it from the prose is itself a perceiver pass and the
// highest-leverage, highest-risk component (open question §17.6) — out of this module.
