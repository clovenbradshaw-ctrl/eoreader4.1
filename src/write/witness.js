// write/witness.js — the witness: rebind, source veto, type law. (SPEC §7)
//
// The witness is INDEPENDENT of the renderer (it never renders). It runs after each
// spurt and owns every factual bind. Four steps:
//
//   7a. OUTBOUND MEMBRANE — bind the surface back to hashIds (coref on return).
//       The output's referents must bind to the union of Sites whose integrals were
//       handed in (`expect`, §5). A referent that was never handed in is suspect —
//       "his mother" at a cursor whose handed integral was Gregor is flagged
//       immediately. Legible audit and tight witness are the same annotation.
//   7b. SOURCE VETO — every FACTUAL claim is checked against the source spans.
//       Ungrounded claims are RETRACTED. Exafference can anchor; me cannot (§8).
//   7c. TYPE LAW (§8) — me-content organizes structure, never certifies. The
//       witness READS provenance as a type: only EXAFFERENT source (the perceiver
//       door, current ingest) may anchor a claim. The model's own spurt is
//       reafferent and is not of the witnessing type, so it can never ground itself,
//       and prior-self text reloaded as "source" (read-back-of-prior-self) cannot
//       either. The rule is not enforced as a policy; it falls out of the type.
//   7d. PAY THE RETRACTION — a forced retraction is LOGGED and SURFACED, never
//       hidden (§10). The append-only log, the void, and the type law are what keep
//       the learning signal from being counterfeit.
//
// Surf-the-spurt does STRUCTURE; veto-the-source does TRUTH (§7). Re-surfing the
// model's own production (spurt.js, §6) is admissible — it is reafference re-entering
// as perceivable — but every factual claim in that production is still vetoed against
// the source, because the production is the model's output, not evidence.

// words are carried by a single source span. The production grounder is
