// write/frame.js — the piece-grain frame: each beat's site, measured not declared.
// (The Streaming Answer §8)
//
// A beat should know what kind of SITE it falls in — opening ground, the salient
// turn, the relation drawn across — but two things must hold or the discipline
// collapses into a template: the frame must be EMERGENT (read off the field, never
// a schema) and the TALKER MUST NOT SEE IT.
//
// THE FRAME IS THE Ground/Figure/Pattern TRIAD, RAISED ONE GRAIN. Phasepost
// (classify/phasepost.js, classify/bands.js) measures every PROPOSITION into three
// positions — Ground (the terrain a clause rests on), Figure (the act that stands
// out), Pattern (the relation laid across the field). The frame is that same
// partition run over the ANSWER SO FAR instead of a single clause: `frameAt`
// measures whether THIS beat is doing Ground-work, Figure-work, or Pattern-work in
// the emergent piece. Same instrument, one level up — the holonic transcend-and-
// include (the beat is a Figure as a sentence; at the grain above it occupies a
// position in a Pattern).
//
// IT IS EMERGENT BECAUSE IT IS READ OFF THE FIELD. There is no intro→body→conclusion
// table. The site falls out of quantities the fold + surf already maintain — the
// SAME scalar the surfer rode (docs/surfing-the-fold.md), so the two cannot disagree:
//   • early, the integral mass is thin — terrain is still being laid — so opening
//     beats measure into GROUND (establishing, not yet asserting);
//   • the steepest Bayesian-surprise stop (surf.peak) is where the reading was
//     rewritten — the salient move — so it measures into FIGURE (the turn);
//   • after the turn, and at a REC firing under accumulated strain, the relation is
//     drawn across the whole field, so the closing beats measure into PATTERN.
// "Hook → bona fides → turn → land" is the human's NAME for this trajectory, not its
// cause; the shape is discovered, never imposed.
//
// IT IS A POSTERIOR, AND IT MAY HOLD. `frameAt` commits a position only above a
// floor (the field has real structure); otherwise it holds at no-commit and the
// cursor falls back to a neutral posture — the same honesty as the predictor's VOID.
//
// THE TALKER NEVER SEES IT. The site is an address, never a token (phasepost.md).
// `frameAt` conditions the cursor's SURFACE only — its posture, its target in plain
// words ("open the ground here", "make the move", "draw it together"), its budget.
// It NEVER emits a typed edge (a wrong edge ships a claim the fold cannot un-say);
// the frame shapes how a thing is said, the witness still owns whether it is true.
