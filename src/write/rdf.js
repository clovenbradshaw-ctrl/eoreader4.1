// The brief as RDF-star — triples the LLM already knows, annotated with the EO richness.
//
// A flat x→relation→y triple is a standard an LLM has seen a million times (RDF/Turtle/OWL),
// so it is a good carrier. But a bare triple throws away everything that makes the edge an EO
// edge: WHICH operator drew it, WHERE on the cube it lands (the site terrain), HOW DEFINITELY
// it holds (the resolution band), WHEN it was constituted (the arrow of time), and WHOSE it is
// (the provenance door). We keep the triple as the spine and hang that richness off it with
// RDF-star quoted-triple annotations — `<< s p o >> eo:op … ; eo:site … ; eo:band …` — under a
// small eo: vocabulary. The LLM reads the triple as content and the annotations as how to say
// it: a hedged band → "seems to"; a firm one → asserted; the order → narrative sequence; a
// Network site → a recurring pattern, a Link → a single relation. Nothing distributional here —
// the annotations are read straight off the log's operators, so this is the EO graph expressed
// in a notation the model can consume, not a translation that loses it.
