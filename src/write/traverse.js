// You do not write word-first. You hold the concept IMAGISTICALLY — the activated
// relation graph the reading constituted, a scene of entities and the relations between
// them — and you TRAVERSE that graph to find what to say, lexicalising each step as you
// go. The traversal order is the order of saying, and it comes from the CONCEPT (the
// graph's own structure and activation), not from the source text's order. Each step is
// realised by writing-as-reading-backwards (refer.js): the surface form is chosen so the
// reader's coref field resolves it back to the intended entity.
//
// This is the demonstrable KERNEL of the Enacted Writer holon (fold/folds/scheduler/
// witness), which is the production path with the full nested-instrument theory of mind
// and the streaming surface. Here: take a held graph, walk it, speak it — with the
// referring rules and the me-ness/self line active (refer.js).

// generator recombines and re-frames; it never fabricates a fact the graph does not hold):
//   cursor  the entity in focus — say only what it touches (its local subgraph). Moving the
//           cursor re-centres the telling on a different participant.
//   frame   the lens on the relations — a relType bucket (or set, or predicate). Say only the
//           bonds that fall under it, so the same scene told "through perception" and "through
//           motion" are different texts. The frame is the active reading lens, run forward.
// Both are SELECTION (what to say); the arrow of time still fixes ORDER (when). They compose.
