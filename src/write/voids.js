// write/voids.js — the open-Resolution query: the fuel and the "Open" ledger. (SPEC §15, §16)
//
// The idle loop walks the OPEN RESOLUTIONS — the void-set: referents INS'd but not
// DEF'd, deferred identities, hedged claims, threads left open (§1–§2). These are
// exactly the points where more thinking can still PAY — where the model is not yet
// committed, so a fresh document can still produce compression progress (§14).
// Re-narrating the FIRM log is rumination (no new likelihood); chasing pure noise is
// dreaming (incompressible). The voids are the fuel; the firm record is not.
//
// The same query feeds the §16 UX: "Open" is the centerpiece — the instrument's
// standing not-knowing, made legible. An entry is { rid, head, text, band, reason }
// with band ∈ { void, hedged }, the form the prototype (idle-ux.html) renders.
