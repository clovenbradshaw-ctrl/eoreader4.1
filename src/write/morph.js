// EO: DEF·NUL(Void → Void, Making,Clearing) — past-tense morphology (the productive rules)
// Past-tense morphology for realization — turn a bare/gerund relation-verb into the
// narrative past so a retelling reads as prose, not telegraphese ("accept"→"accepted",
// "jump"→"jumped", "pushing"→"pushed", "make"→"made"). The parse often hands us a verb with
// its auxiliary stripped ("would accept", "was pushing"), so the surface tense is lost; this
// recovers the simple past, the default narrative tense.
//
// This is English's morphological HOW — a closed convention, the same kind as the engine's
// seed conjunction/preposition lists, and learnable from the corpus's attested verb forms. A
// form that is ALREADY past (it ends in -ed, or is a known irregular past) is left untouched,
// so a source that already gave "woke / saw / brought" is unchanged.

// The closed irregular set is the PACKAGED English-morphology convention (core/conventions/
// english-verbs.js), the same curated-lexicon "packaged way" as the seed speech/relation
// lists — not a table hand-rolled here. This module is only the productive RULES.
