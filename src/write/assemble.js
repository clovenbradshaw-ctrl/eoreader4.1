// Every piece we built converges here. Given a document and the activated conversation thread,
// this runs: thread salience (the Born rule over terms · figures · links) → an adaptive surf
// that keeps as much as is salient → the salient relation edges → the EO-enriched RDF-star
// brief (each triple annotated with operator · site · band · order · door) → the realization
// prompt. The return is exactly the system+user the talker would receive, plus the structure
// behind it (the salient stops, the focus's trajectory) so the decision is legible. Nothing
// here decides content the model could fabricate — it selects, from the graph, what is grounded
// and salient, and hands it over in a notation the model can consume.
