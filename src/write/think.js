// EO: INS·SIG·REC(Network,Void → Void,Field, Cultivating,Tending,Composing) — inner speech turned inward; voids as fuel
// write/think.js — thinking as impressionistic talking turned inward. (the inner-speech loop)
//
// The phraser→talker arc (brief.js) runs OUTWARD: an impression (the pre-verbal scene a
// reading left) is voiced as words for someone else. Turn that same arc INWARD and you have
// thinking. You voice an impression to yourself — sub-vocally, the phraser's own draft, no
// mouth needed — then you READ YOUR OWN WORDS BACK. The reading re-activates the graph, the
// activation migrates the focus to a figure the utterance reached, and you voice again from
// there. That wander, voice → hear-yourself → re-focus → voice, is inner speech: not a
// monologue authored from nowhere but spreading activation along the graph, each step
// grounded in what the last step actually touched.
//
// The phraser is the inner voice; the LLM talker is the mouth. So thinking needs no model —
// it runs on the formulator's output before articulation (Levelt's internal speech, the
// phonological loop). The mouth is for OUTER speech (brief.js / talkThenVerify); here the
// words never leave.
//
// Three things keep this from being rumination — the architecture's worst failure at full
// duty cycle (idle.js's warning: re-perceive your own output as world and you spin):
//
//   ME-NESS (the firewall).  Every thought is voiced through the ENACTOR door (fromEnactor):
//     it is reafference, mine, and CANNOT witness (core/provenance §8). When it is read back
//     it re-enters through the perceiver door but keeps its enactor origin — classify() reads
//     READ_BACK-of-prior-self, never fresh world. So thinking reorganises attention; it never
//     adds a fact. canWitness(thought) === false, by type, not by flag. (This is exactly
//     idle.js's I2 Firewall, applied per thought.)
//
//   GROUNDED.  A thought can only be about figures and relations the graph holds — the
//     propositions come off the doc's own bonds (phraserBrief), fabrication-incapable. The
//     focus can only migrate to a figure some voiced proposition reached. You cannot think
//     your way to a figure that is not in the scene.
//
//   SELF-TERMINATING.  Activation is γ-decayed and the focus only ever moves to an unvisited
//     figure. When no voiced proposition reaches a fresh figure, the train quiesces (idle.js's
//     I3 median band). It does not spin. A hard maxThoughts bound is the backstop.
