// This engine is the PHRASER: it determines WHAT to say — grounded propositions read off the
// document's own graph, provenance-stamped and fabrication-incapable — plus a telegraphic
// draft already realised (referring expressions, tense, aggregation). An LLM TALKER then only
// makes it FLUENT. The talker decides no content: the brief gives it the determined
// propositions, the prompt forbids adding any, and the post-check (classifyProvenance) strips
// whatever it adds anyway. So the output is fluent AND fabrication-incapable — content and
// grounding are ours, wording is the talker's, and the veto closes the loop. This is the
// honest place for a model: surface realisation behind a propositional veto, never content.
