// reason/index.js — the reasoning-walk holon entrance.
//
// The walk over the append-only log: continuous, meaningful output as ACCUMULATION over
// committed steps, each voiced through the enactor door (canWitness false, by type), each
// graded (grounded / warranted-ungrounded / idle-ungrounded) off the log, terminating on
// surprise-saturation. See walk.js for the full account and docs/ungrounded-emitted.md for the
// resolution lattice it emits into.
//
// Depends on `core` only. No model. A `propose` backend may be injected to let a talker rank
// the confined menu; the loop, the firewall, the grade, and the termination are model-independent.

// height, regret, the modal family, the enactor-DEF counterfactual, possibility/
// necessity, and reflection, all as specializations of one parameter. IDENTITY folds
// exactly what the ungeneralized function folded (the golden-parity anchor).
