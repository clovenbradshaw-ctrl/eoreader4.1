// reason/walk.js — the reasoning walk: continuous, meaningful output as a loop over the log.
//
// think.js (the inner-speech loop) reorganises attention over structure the corpus ALREADY
// holds: it voices an impression, reads it back through the enactor->perceiver edge, re-focuses,
// and quiesces. Past the ground it emits a VOID — an open question ("What of Klamm?") — never a
// leap into the gap, and it grows a reading by re-parsing grown TEXT (inquire), never committing.
// So it develops attention; it does not develop STRUCTURE, and it never commits.
//
// The walk is the delta. Three moves distinguish it:
//
//   1. IT COMMITS. Each step is a real event appended to the same append-only log the corpus
//      lives on (core/log.js). Step N+1 reads the graph projected over the log INCLUDING step N's
//      event. Continuity is not a string in a context window; it is ACCUMULATION over the log.
//      Step three's conclusion is an admitted span at step four, because it is literally there.
//
//   2. IT REACHES. The moves are SYN / CON / REC — synthesise a figure the corpus never named,
//      bond two figures the corpus left unbonded, learn a rule from a repeated relation. These
//      WRITE NEW and READ-TWO-WRITE-LINK (cube SIGNATURES): structure the corpus did not state.
//      That is the leap the answerability VOID gate would otherwise refuse.
//
//   3. IT CANNOT LAUNDER. Every step is voiced through the ENACTOR door (fromEnactor): reafference,
//      mine. By the provenance type law (core/provenance §8) canWitness(step) is FALSE — not by a
//      flag, by the type. A step can ORIENT the next step (canOrient is true for every provenance)
//      but can never WITNESS a later claim as world. A chain that read its own output as ground
//      would drift into confabulation with perfect internal citations — the worst failure, because
//      it looks audited. The type law makes that drift impossible. This is idle.js's I2 firewall,
//      per committed step.
//
// The grade a step carries (docs/ungrounded-emitted.md) is READ OFF THE LOG, never elected:
//   grounded              an EXAFFERENT event (the corpus, canWitness true) attests this claim.
//   warranted-ungrounded  no exafferent witness, but a prior REC generalises a regularity that WAS
//                         exafferently witnessed (>= 2 corpus pairs), and this step instantiates it.
//   idle-ungrounded       a bare reach: no exafferent witness, no backing rule. Shipped, marked.
//
// Termination is SATURATION, not a token budget: the walk stops when the best available reach adds
// no fresh structure the field did not already hold — the one surprise (core/surprise.js) goes flat.
// A hard maxSteps is the backstop only (arc §5.7: it should never bind if saturation is working).
//
// The loop needs NO model. A `propose` backend may be injected to let a talker RANK the confined
// menu; the loop, the firewall, the grade and the termination are model-independent. The reasoning
// is the walk over the graph, not a draw from a large network.
