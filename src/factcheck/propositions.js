// EO: EVA·SYN(Field,Network,Lens → Lens,Network, Binding,Composing) — proposition DEF-claim veto (P2)
// The proposition channel — the claim-grain veto for DEF predications (the P2
// channel the edge-grounding veto left open).
//
// The edge veto (correspond.js) parses the talker's prose into CON/SIG EDGES and
// checks each against the document graph. It is, by construction, EDGES-ONLY: a
// single-argument predication — "O'Connell is a council member" — has no second
// entity, produces no edge, and slips the check whole. That is exactly the miss
// this closes: a deep-research answer called Freddie O'Connell "a Metro Council
// member" while the very sources it stood on say "Mayor Freddie O'Connell". The
// stale role survived because nothing evaluated the PROPOSITION the answer made
// about a single figure.
//
// This channel does for DEF propositions what correspond.js does for edges:
//
//   1. EVALUATE every proposition the answer asserts — parseProps reads the
//      talker's prose into resolved props (the same parser the page is read with),
//      and this channel takes the DEF (one-place, subject + predicate) ones the
//      edge channel cannot see.
//   2. CHECK each against the SOURCES AT THE CORRECT CURSOR — the document's own
//      DEF propositions are read sentence-by-sentence, EACH at the cursor where it
//      sits, so "as a council member, he WAS a critic" (a past frame at its own
//      line) is read as a FORMER role, distinct from "he IS the mayor" read at the
//      line that asserts it. A claim is graded against the source reading that
//      governs it, not against a bag of words pooled across the corpus.
//
// The new verdicts, beside corroborated / unsupported:
//
//   superseded  the answer asserts an exclusive OFFICE (mayor, council member,
//               governor, …) as current, but the sources currently witness a
//               DIFFERENT exclusive office for the same person and do NOT currently
//               witness the claimed one. The role the answer gives has been
//               succeeded — the O'Connell catch. Flag-and-tell with the current
//               office and its citation, never a substitution.
//   stale       the answer asserts an office as current, but the sources mark that
//               same office as FORMER and do not currently witness it ("former
//               council member" against "is a council member").
//
// Like the edge veto this is a correspondence between two readings, never a claim
// against truth (edge-grounding.md): it makes the answer faithful to the sources at
// the cursor, not the sources faithful to the world. And it is conservative by
// construction — supersession fires only between offices a person holds ONE of at a
// time, only when the current office is positively witnessed, and only when the
// answer asserts the stale role AS current. False negatives (a title outside the
// exclusive set, a person sharing a surname) are the honest seam; a false refusal
// is the thing it must never do, so it only ever flags.
