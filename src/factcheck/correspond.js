// against the graph. Parse the talker's prose into propositions, type each one
// the way the page is typed, and check each claimed edge against the document
// reading the fold built. A claimed edge with no corresponding document edge is
// unbound in the LINK sense, the way an uncited claim is unbound in the NODE
// sense — this is the veto the invented-location claim slipped past, because the
// node-grounding check looked at nodes and the lie was shaped like a link.
//
// Both sides are Meant. The graph is the document reading, defeasible, folded to
// a cursor; the talker's parsed edge is a reading of the talker's own prose. So
// a mismatch does not mean the talker lied about the world — it means the talker
// asserted a relation the document reading does not contain. That is the right
// thing to catch, and it is all the check can honestly claim to catch (§10): it
// makes the talker faithful to the graph, not the graph faithful to the world.
//
// The check REUSES three organs already built — the SVO clause parser, the
// document referent table, the centroid classifier — and adds the four-way
// verdict and the geometric relation comparison.

// grain directly, not an addition to the relation typer. Until it lands, the guard
// covers Figure-at-Void (the hard confabulation, rightly closed first) and stays silent
// on Ground over-reads (the softer case).
//

// terrain — a tone claim at an Atmosphere — is ON the diagonal, grain-coherent, so the
