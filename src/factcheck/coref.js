// Coreference as proposal — the talker's coref strength cashed in honestly.
//
// The talker is good at coreference: it binds "the trooper," "Sgt. Topps," "the
// off-duty officer," and "he" to one person across long spans and through
// paraphrase, better than the document SYN does. That capability is real. But
// inside the fact-check, letting the talker RESOLVE the endpoints of its own
// claim is the witness grading its own testimony (edge-grounding §5). So the
// talker may PROPOSE bindings and may never resolve them.
//
// The talker finds the candidate; the measuring readers confirm it on
// document-side evidence. The proposal enters as a talker-witnessed perception,
// deposited as capped, tagged conversational mass through the same
// reinforce-as-deposition path as any other talker contribution. A GROUNDING
// reader must corroborate before the merge commits: the geometric reader finding
// the two spans near in the document's own meaning space, or the distribution
// supporting it. The merge commits when a grounding reader seconds the proposal
// and HOLDS when none does. Tip, never originate — the proposal and the
// confirmation come from different readers with different witnesses, which is
// exactly what captures the talker's coref strength without the
// witness-grades-itself problem.
