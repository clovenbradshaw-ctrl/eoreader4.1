// The factcheck holon: the edge-grounding veto — the fact-checker.
//
// Translate the talker's output into EO notation and compare it against the
// graph. Parse the talker's prose into propositions, type each one the way the
// page is typed, and check each claimed edge against the document reading the
// fold built. A claimed edge with no corresponding document edge is unbound in
// the LINK sense, the way an uncited claim is unbound in the NODE sense — the
// veto the invented-location claim slipped past, because the node check looked at
// nodes and the lie was shaped like a link.
//
// The check is a correspondence between two Meant structures: it makes the talker
// faithful to the graph, never the graph faithful to the world. It reuses the SVO
// clause parser, the document referent table, and the centroid classifier, and
// adds the four-way verdict, the geometric relation comparison, and the
// coref-as-proposal mechanism — the talker proposes bindings; document-side
// readers dispose.
