// The DAG holon — extract a DAG from a corpus, with two cursors.
//
// (1) discourseDag — the flow of content WITHIN the document itself (discourse.js).
// (2) assertedDag  — the DAG of the content being described qua itself: the causal graph each
//     source IMPLICITLY ASSERTS, as READ by the reader, laid side by side and sourced.
//
// THE BOUNDARY, which is the whole spine. A causal effect is a counterfactual and does not live
// in a corpus. So this holon NEVER produces "X causes Y". It produces, at three guarded removes:
//     the reader READS a passage  →  as proposing that a source CLAIMS  →  X causes Y.
// `claim-src` bars the collapse into fact; `reading:true` + readerConfidence bar the collapse
// into "the source settled it"; and there is deliberately NO method that returns an effect size
// or upgrades a proposed stance. The value on a causal question is not the truth — it is
// stripping the false confidence off the claim and showing what would have to be true, and is
// not shown, for it to hold.
//
// TWO CONSTRAINTS keep it honest (and they are enforced, not just promised):
//   • FLOOR, not ceiling. It proposes the space of stories the CORPUS tells, not the space of
//     possible stories. It can miss a confounder no source named. `floor:true` says so.
//   • WITNESS-FIRST. Every node, edge, confounder, mechanism, and NUL traces to the passage
//     that proposed it. Nothing is invented; the worst failure is inventing a cause.
