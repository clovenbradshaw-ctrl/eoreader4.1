// enactor/efference.js — the efference copy (add-on 3 §3, §5).
//
// Output is not terminal. At the moment of COMMITMENT the core does two things:
// it emits the committed proposition to an output organ (to be rendered into the
// world), AND it generates an EFFERENCE COPY — the predicted sensed-consequence
// of that commit, indexed to it, and held outstanding. When the system later
// perceives its own output through the ordinary senses, the monitor (Phase 4)
// compares each sensed proposition against the outstanding copies: a match is the
// system sensing what it produced — me-ness — and is attenuated; a sensed prop
// with no matching copy is the world.
//
// Two kinds of prediction live in the core, and the difference is what draws the
// self/world line (§3):
//
//   PERCEPTUAL  what will the world send next? not indexed to any action.
//               a miss is surprise (the perceiver's strain). [predict/]
//   EFFERENCE   what will I sense as a consequence of THIS commit? indexed to a
//               specific commitment. a match is me-ness. [here]
//
// They are one forward model pointed two ways (§5): the engine predicts forward
// over propositions whether the proposition's source is the world or the self.
// The efference copy is that engine pointed at the self — and for now, the
// skeleton prediction is IDENTITY: committing P, I predict I will sense P return
// (deepened later, when the forward model can predict a transformed consequence,
// with no shape change — the copy is already a proposition-keyed prediction).
//
// The copy is MODALITY-BLIND: it carries the proposition's identity, not the
// organ that rendered it. Talking while gesturing is two commits and two copies
// flowing through one monitor, not two monitors (§4). One copy form, one self.
