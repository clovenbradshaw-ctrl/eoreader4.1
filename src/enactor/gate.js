// enactor/gate.js — the collapse (§5). DEF·EVA·REC over propositions.
//
// The enactor's COMMIT step, modality-blind (add-on 3 §1): the gate runs over
// propositions, so the same collapse commits a spoken proposition, a pass, or a
// struck note. It lives in the core, not the speech organ; the organ only renders
// candidate surfaces for the gate to judge.
//
// The gate is the line between thinking and speaking (Levelt's inner monitor;
// Dehaene's ignition threshold). It runs per candidate PROPOSITION, not per
// token. The proposal advances one proposition past the committed edge
// (speculative); SEG closes the candidate; the gate measures it against the
// grounded basis by RELATIONAL correspondence and collapses what beats the null
// into speech, holding or VOIDing the rest.
//
//   committedContext  the grounded speech so far (starts empty)
//   loop:
//     candidateProp ← segment() closes a proposition past the committed edge
//     EVA: two correspondences, both relational (talker/props.js):
//       findingMatch  = correspond(svo, basis.props)            // is it TRUE
//       questionMatch = correspond(svo, basis.question.targets) // is it RESPONSIVE
//       support    = basis amplitude of the matched finding (0 if none)
//       relevance  = question amplitude of the matched target (0 if none)
//       redundancy = 1 − already-spoken support for this prop
//       projection = modelAmplitude × support × relevance × redundancy
//     REC: threshold against the derived null at alpha:
//       projection > null → COLLAPSE: append to committed, EMIT surface, deplete
//       else              → ROLL BACK; regenerate, discouraging this direction;
//                           OR, no prop can match the remaining targets → VOID
//                           ("the text does not say", the fixed conscience token)
//     stop when the question's targets are exhausted (basis depleted)
//
// The multiply is the protection (§5). Three failure modes, one multiply:
//   true-but-irrelevant   support>0, relevance≈0  → product≈0 → held
//   fluent hallucination  support=0               → product=0 → cannot collapse
//   on-question, unsupported (the dangerous one)  relevance>0, support=0
//                                                 → product=0 → blocked, VOIDs
