// EO: SEG·EVA(Field → Field,Lens, Dissecting,Tracing) — the SEG cut
// predict/segment.js — the SEG cut, learned from the note grain's own surprise.
//
// The grain-nested predictor (grained.js) took phrase boundaries as INPUT. Finding
// them is the SEG problem — the Existence→Structure cut — and the README's claim
// is that the signal marks them itself: "predicting the next position and being
// surprised when it deviates marks the frame the shape turned." A first attempt
// at a flat surprise threshold over-fired badly (24 phrases for 8): a cold model
// is surprised everywhere, not only at boundaries, so a fixed cutoff turns a
// plateau of newness into a crowd of false cuts.
//
// This derives the cut the way the void-boundary does (scripts/void-boundary.mjs,
// read/voidnull.js): the threshold is a READOUT the signal computes from its own
// surprise background — a high quantile — and the only number a human states is
// ALPHA, the tolerated rate of mistaking ordinary newness for a boundary. Two more
// signal-derived guards turn the plateau into peaks:
//
//   · a boundary is a LOCAL PEAK in surprise, not merely a high value — the rise
//     marks the discontinuity, the plateau does not;
//   · a minimum phrase length (minGap) — two cuts cannot sit on top of each other,
//     because a phrase has extent (the same "a shape has extent" coherence the
//     video reader uses to tell a blob from snow).
//
// Pure over the surprise series; no model call beyond the note grain already run.
