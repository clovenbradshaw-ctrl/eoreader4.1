// The fold-voice — a voice is a fold, not a generation (docs/chorus.md, "The
// fold-voice").
//
// A voice is a mechanical object the surfer produces: a fold at an address,
// carrying a weight. It is NOT model output. Model output is a compression —
// structure narrated into prose with the coordinate lost, invisibly. A fold is a
// projection: addressed and recoverable. The polyphony stays on the projection
// side of that line, so the voices are folds and only folds.
//
// A fold-voice carries:
//   address    — (level, face, cell). face is 'cube' for a primary-measure cell,
//                or 'act'|'site'|'stance' for a face-marginal cell.
//   amp        — the raw signed cosine projection onto the centroid (null on a
//                marginal, which is a sum of squares and has no single sign).
//   weight     — the squared, normalized Born mass.
//   provenance — the contributing spans and the frameSig that formed it.
//
// It is grounder-side, deterministic, and carries NO prose. Prose is the vox
// leaf's job (vox.js), and only ever for a single selected fold.

// One fold-voice. Frozen; carries no prose. `spans` and `frameSig` are the
// provenance — what formed this fold, so the render can trace it and the vox can
// be handed the excerpts. `amp` is optional (marginals have none).
