// The render — a weighted map, mechanical, no generation (docs/chorus.md, "The
// render").
//
// The output is a weighted map, and the map IS the answer for most queries. Per
// level, a lane. Within a lane, the cube's mass across cells, with the three
// face-marginals available as the three readable projections. Two incompatible
// cells both carrying high mass are drawn as an EVA-site, held side by side,
// unresolved — productive ambiguity, not an error to reconcile. The move from one
// level's lane to the next is drawn as a REC-transition, the rotation made
// visible. The cell at SYN by Ground carries zero mass in every physical reading
// and is drawn as silence, a preserved absence — the empty slot kept as data.
//
// The render NEVER collapses the lanes into one. Collapse is SYN, and SYN here
// would be the compression we are avoiding. A reader may project the whole thing
// down to one lane or one face on demand and lose nothing, because the rest is
// parked with its address and recoverable (fold.js). That recoverability is the
// entire reason the voices had to be folds. This module emits DATA — a structured
// map — not pixels; a UI renders it, but the reading lives here.
