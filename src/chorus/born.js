// The Born measure — the reframe stated as arithmetic (docs/chorus.md, "The measure is Born").
//
// The geometric reader (src/classify/phasepost.js) scores a clause against the
// 27 cell centroids and then, per band, takes the argmax. That last step is a
// HARD measurement: it keeps one cell and discards the rest of the distribution.
// The chorus keeps the distribution instead. This module is the arithmetic that
// lets it.
//
// The cosine vector against the 27 centroids is a set of SIGNED amplitudes. The
// spec's two moves:
//
//   1. Square them, normalize to sum one → a distribution over the 27-cell ground.
//      Squaring suppresses the weak projections QUADRATICALLY. That is the
//      property argmax crudely approximated and a linear weighting cannot give:
//      the signal-from-noise step. It is why we say Born and not "use the scores".
//
//   2. A voice is a fold, not a generation — see fold.js. This module only makes
//      the measure; it emits no prose and touches no model. Deterministic.
//
// The amplitude is the signed cosine, kept signed all the way to the square, so
// that Probe B (interference across spans, probe.js) can see cross-span
// cancellation before the sign is lost. Callers that already hold a MiniLM query
// vector and the centroid bundle get their amplitudes from `cubeAmplitudes`;
// callers holding raw numbers use `bornWeights` directly.

// Signed cosine — identical to the classifier's, kept here so the measure module
// has no dependency on the classifier. The sign is load-bearing (Probe B), so it
// is never abs'd.

// point where the reading is more about what the frame is NOT standing on than what
