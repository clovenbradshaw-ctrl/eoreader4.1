// EO: SEG·SIG(Field,Kind → Lens, Unraveling,Tending) — face marginals
// The three faces as axis-marginals of the cube (docs/chorus.md, "The fold-voice").
//
// The primary measure is the distribution over the 27-cell cube (born.js). The
// three faces are its axis-marginals, each a nine-cell distribution got by
// summing the cube over the third axis. Lenses and cells are then ONE structure:
// the cube is the reading, a lens is a marginal of it, and there is no separate
// machinery for faces.
//
// A cell key is `OP_Stance_Site`. The operator fixes (Mode, Domain) — the Act
// face; the stance fixes (Mode, grain); the site fixes (Domain, grain). So each
// cell sits at (Mode, Domain, grain), and the three marginals sum it out one
// axis at a time (matching core/faces.js FACES exactly):
//
//   Act    (Mode   × Domain)  → 9 operators — sum the cube over grain
//   Site   (Domain × grain )  → 9 terrains  — sum the cube over mode
//   Stance (Mode   × grain )  → 9 stances   — sum the cube over domain
//
// This is pure arithmetic over the Born weights. No model, no argmax.

// than mis-summed.
