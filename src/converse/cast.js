// EO: DEF·EVA·REC(Entity,Field → Entity,Paradigm, Dissecting,Binding,Composing) — conversation cast (source-activation memory)
// The conversation cast as a DEF→EVA→REC cycle (docs/operators.md, the Interpretation column;
// docs/source-activation.md, "landing on the referent").
//
// `referenceTarget` (reference.js) reads the turn's referent in ONE shot — the warmest figure
// the conversation holds — and keeps no memory. So a thin follow-up the live read cannot
// resolve ("no, the newest one") degrades to the loudest retrieval hit, and the reading wanders
// off the thing being discussed. The cast is the missing state: it remembers what the
// conversation has SETTLED on and carries it forward.
//
//   DEF (assert/define) — the referents under discussion are an explicit, persisted set, not a
//                         warmth ranking re-derived from scratch each turn.
//   EVA (evaluate frames)— which defined referent does THIS turn concern? The live read wins
//                         when it resolves; only when it resolves NOTHING does a settled
//                         referent the conversation is still holding carry forward, instead of
//                         the reading collapsing onto the loudest span.
//   REC (learn a rule)  — commit a referent as SETTLED only when the fold CONCENTRATED on the
//                         turn's target (referential.concentrated). A diffuse, wandering read
//                         commits nothing, so the carried state is never poisoned by it.
//
// Threaded through the session like the Horizon (surfer/horizon.js): one cast spans the
// conversation and accumulates. Null on a default turn → the fold is byte-identical and the
// read stays single-shot, exactly as before.
