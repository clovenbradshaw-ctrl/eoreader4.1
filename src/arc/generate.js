// generateSection — one section's draft, floored and ceilinged by its evidence.
//
// The section is generated as a gated sub-turn: the section's `subClaim` (a
// retrieval-derived topic hint) stands in for the raw question, and the prompt
// is grounded on the cluster's OWN spans — nothing else. This reuses the model
// holon's grounded prompt builder, so a section speaks the same language as a
// turn; the arc adds only the per-section budget.
//
// The ceiling is a hard `maxTokens` cap. The FLOOR is advisory at this layer: a
// `min_tokens` logit processor enforces it in the model holon when the backend
// exposes one (spec-the-lens-port); a phrase()-only backend cannot be made to
// keep decoding, so the floor rides as a budget the section records and the
// faithfulness gate reads. We pass both into the model opts so a floor-aware
// backend can honour them and a plain one ignores them — non-breaking either way.
