// EO contracts for the flow holon — the Act/Site/Stance faces of every module,
// with the Site face split into targets (what it reads) and products (what it writes).
// Generated from the per-holon analysis; validated by tests/contracts.test.js against
// the cube's coherence guard. See docs/eo-for-coders.md and docs/spec-good-watchmaker.md.
