// doc/events.js — EO change tracking as an append-only log.
//
// A written document is not a mutable buffer; it is a fold of edit events, the
// same way the graph is a fold of the reading log and the deep-research report
// is a fold of the research log. Every edit — an inserted line, a rewrite, a
// deletion — is a CHANGE_PROPOSE event carrying its GROUNDING CHECK against the
// Record; accepting or rejecting it is another event. Nothing is silently
// mutated, so the document's whole history (who · when · what it grounds to) is
// replayable and auditable, and an edit that "leaves the record" can never be
// kept without being marked.
//
// This mirrors ProseMirror's "changes are first-class values" and Google Docs'
// suggesting mode, but the value is an event on the log, not an editor-internal
// object — so it survives reload, export, and audit like everything else here.

export const DKIND = {
  CREATE: 'DOC_CREATE',      // a document is opened
  BLOCK:  'BLOCK_ADD',       // a committed block (seeding, or a direct edit in Editing mode)
  EDIT:   'BLOCK_EDIT',      // a fine, committed edit to one block — one typing burst (Editing mode)
  PROPOSE: 'CHANGE_PROPOSE', // a tracked change, awaiting review (Suggesting mode)
  ACCEPT: 'CHANGE_ACCEPT',   // a change folded into the document
  REJECT: 'CHANGE_REJECT',   // a change dropped
  REVERT: 'DOC_REVERT',      // the document restored to an earlier point in the log

// Every event carries two clocks: `t`, a monotonic sequence used only for
// ordering, and `ts`, the wall-clock millisecond the edit happened (0 when
// unknown). The projection reads neither — the log's array order is the truth —
// but the history view reads `ts` to bucket edits by age (recent shown fine, old
// coalesced). Keeping `ts` on the event, not derived at view time, is what makes
// the timeline replay-stable: the same log always folds to the same history.

// `html` carries the block's inline rich formatting (bold/italic/links/…); `text`

// and AFTER, so the history view can diff them character by character. `grounding`
// is the raw check result (as CHANGE_PROPOSE carries); the projection re-grounds
// the block on the new text, exactly as an accepted replace would. Folding is

// this version"): the whole history is preserved and the revert is itself a
// revertable event, so you can always undo a restore. `label` is the human name
