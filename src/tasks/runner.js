// tasks/runner.js — runTaskGraph: drive a goal down to leaves a small LLM can
// generate, re-projecting the graph after every event.
//
// The runner is the only stateful piece, and the state it owns is the one durable
// thing: the append-only TaskEvent log. Everything else — the nested graph, the
// statuses, the assembled output — is PROJECTED from that log. After each event
// it re-projects and hands the fresh graph to `onUpdate`, so a UI watches the
// tree fill in and a small model only ever sees one leaf-sized goal at a time.
//
// TWO INJECTED FACES, no LLM imported here (the holon stays pure and testable):
//
//   decompose(view) → [subGoal, ...] | []   the planner. Returns sub-goals while
//     a goal is too big for one reach; returns [] (or null) when it is small
//     enough to generate directly. May be a small LLM, or a heuristic, or a fixed
//     plan. This is what makes the levels NESTED — a returned sub-goal is expanded
//     by the same recursion, so depth is whatever the planner asks for.
//
//   generate(view) → string | { output, sources }   the generative engine, run
//     ONCE PER LEAF. Because every leaf is small by construction, a small model
//     can produce it. This is the whole point: decomposition turns "write the
//     long answer" — which a small model fumbles — into a forest of one-bite
//     generations it can each do well.
//
// `view` is a read-only descriptor: { id, goal, depth, parentId, ancestry, grain,
// object, cell } where ancestry is the goal chain root→parent, and the cube
// fields tell each face what grain it is operating at — the decomposer sees the
// goal's declared grain, the leaf generator KNOWS it is a Figure-maker (INS at
// Figure), so neither has to guess its place on the cube.
