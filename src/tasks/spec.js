// tasks/spec.js — the TASK CREATOR: a request → an artifact spec → a decomposition.
//
// The tasks holon (runner.js) drives a goal down to leaves and generates each one,
// but it imports no model and chooses no shape — `decompose` and `generate` arrive
// injected. The runner's own doc names the gap: `decompose` "may be a small LLM, or
// a heuristic, or a FIXED PLAN." This module is the fixed-plan face for generative
// artifacts. When the request is "write an essay", an essay is not a shapeless reach
// — it has a LENGTH, a FORMAT, and a STRUCTURE (open with a thesis, develop it in
// ordered paragraphs, close without a new claim). The creator reads the kind off the
// request, looks up that shape, and hands the runner a decomposition that already
// embodies it.
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT THE ANTI-CANON longgen/shape.js FORBIDS. There the system answers a
// question FROM A DOCUMENT, and a fixed response schema is a lie — it supplies a
// balance the evidence cannot earn (McKeown's schemata, "a void gate run backwards").
// That argument is about a GROUNDED READING: the shape must fall out of what the field
// offers. This is the opposite case — a GENERATIVE artifact the user asked for by name.
// "Write an essay" IS a request for the essay shape; supplying it is honoring the ask,
// not imposing a frame on evidence. The grounding discipline still rides underneath:
// each leaf the runner generates is grounded on its own spans (runner.js), so the spec
// chooses the SKELETON while the evidence still fills each bone.
//
// THE SMALL-MODEL CONSTRAINT IS THE WHOLE POINT (the runner's thesis, made dimensional).
// A small model can only be handed so much context and can only emit so much output in
// one reach. So every section carries a TOKEN BUDGET, and the budget drives the grain:
//
//   tokens ≤ LEAF_MAX_TOKENS   → a Figure leaf — one small-model reach writes it whole.
//   tokens >  LEAF_MAX_TOKENS   → a Pattern goal — too big for one bite, split further.
//
// That is exactly the cube's stopping rule (grain.js): keep decomposing while a goal is
// Pattern-grained, make a leaf only once it is Figure-grained — here read off a real
// budget, not guessed. A spec whose sections all fit the ceiling is a flat plan; ask for
// a LONG essay and the body paragraphs overflow the ceiling and nest one level deeper,
// each part still a one-reach generation. Length scales the budget; the budget scales the
// tree; the tree keeps every generation inside what a small model can actually produce.
//
// THREE SOURCES OF A SHAPE, in priority order (`createTaskSpec`):
//   1. a LEARNED definition — one the caller defined previously (the library cache).
//   2. a BUILT-IN template — the shapes shipped here (essay, report, story, …).
//   3. NOTHING — `needsResearch` is true; the caller may propose a web search for the
//      "good elements of a <kind>", parse the result with `deriveSpecFromDefinition`,
//      and `define` it into the library so the next request reuses it. The fetch is the
//      caller's (proposer-only, the web.js discipline) — this module never touches the
//      network, exactly as the runner never imports a model.
