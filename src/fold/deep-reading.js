// fold/deep-reading.js — DEEP READING: the reflection at the place of most interest.
//
// The chat posture is inert until prompted; idle.js already argued that idleness is the
// suppression to justify, not the machine's nature (SPEC §15). idle.js walks the OPEN
// SET (the voids) against freshly ingested exafference. Deep reading is the other half of
// the same continuity: when the model is not otherwise busy, instead of waiting on a void
// to be closed by the world, the reading turns back on the DOCUMENT IT ALREADY HOLDS —
// it surfs to the place of most interest, folds it, and has a reflection about it.
//
// The three pieces already exist; deep reading only composes them, with the epistemics
// and the ontology made exact:
//
//   PLACE OF MOST INTEREST — the SURFER's peak (docs/surfing-the-fold.md). Not a router's
//     choice; the reading measures where its own field is steepest (Bayesian surprise) and
//     steps there. With a live conversation thread the peak is re-weighted by salience
//     (surfer/salience.js, the Born rule) so "most interesting" means most interesting to
//     what is being discussed; idle, with no thread, it is the document's own steepest
//     structure. Either way it is read off the physics, never authored.
//
//   THE FOLD — foldNote at that peak (fold/integral.js): the unit of evidence the reading
//     reads, existence + structure + significance integrated, every line carrying its
//     source index so a citation still binds.
//
//   THE REFLECTION — the reading's own act of EVALUATING that fold against its frame. Model-
//     free by default (write/think.js: "thinking needs no model" — the reflection is the
//     significance read voiced as an inner note); a caller with a model injects a richer
//     voice. Either way the epistemics below are identical.
//
// EPISTEMICS — why this is safe to add to the graph (the firewall, idle.js I2 / SPEC §8):
//   A reflection is REAFFERENCE — the reading's own output, mine, `fromEnactor`. By the §8
//   type law canWitness(prov) === false: it can organize attention and continuity but it
//   CANNOT witness anything as world. It rides the graph at band VOID — held open, an
//   interpretation, never asserted as a firm fact — and `grounded:false`. Only a human's
//   witness act could ever promote it (idle.js's confirm). So the loop can reflect freely
//   without laundering self-talk into record: the firewall is the TYPE, not a flag.
//
// ONTOLOGY — which of the nine operators a reflection IS (core/operators.js):
//   EVA — Relate × Interpretation, "evaluate". A reflection is the reading judging a
//   particular (the folded place) against its established terms — exactly the enacted loop's
//   EVA (significance-loop.md, core/enacted/loop.js), so the reflection carries the same
//   verdict (confirm | strain) and surprise. It is tagged `register:'enacted'` (the reading's
//   OWN act, register.js) so it is never conflated with a depicted perception, and projectGraph
//   deliberately skips EVA ("EVA, REC: live in the rules ledger, not in this projection") —
//   so a reflection can NEVER be mistaken for a depicted edge/fact. It surfaces instead as a
//   first-class eo:Reflection node in the reading substrate (fold/substrate.js), beside the
//   eo:Tension (held EVA) and eo:Reframing (located REC) that already live there.
//
// SELF-TERMINATING (idle.js I3) — the loop reflects only where the place BEATS the reach's
// own band (the significance is real, not the flat between peaks), habituates to places it
// has already read (never re-reflects — the cure for rumination), and quiesces when no fresh
// place beats the band. It never spins; a maxPasses backstop is the hard bound.
//
// This is the deterministic ENGINE — surf and reflect injected, no timers, no DOM — so it is
// testable, and a product surface (the app's idle tick) is pure presentation over this state.
// "Not otherwise busy" is the CALLER's signal (only it knows a turn is not in flight); the
// engine exposes arrive() as the wake-on-idle entry (I4), never a self-poll.
