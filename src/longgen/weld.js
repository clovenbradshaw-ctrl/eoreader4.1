// The self-read weld — re-read an accepted paragraph back through the grounder
// before it becomes the prior the next paragraph opens on.
//
// The walk's birth gate (bindAndVeto against the beat's slice) is a lexical
// floor: it certifies that a claim's WORDS made contact with the slice. Drift
// that keeps the slice's words while changing what the prose CLAIMS rides
// straight through it — the Step 0 measurement (docs/self-read-weld-measurement.md)
// put the birth gate's catch rate at 0% across every drift mode it modelled.
// The weld is the re-read that measurement licenses: three signals, each cheap,
// synchronous, and model-free, OR'd per sentence.
//
//   number   — a quantity the sentence carries that its slice does not: the
//              paragraph asserts a magnitude the fold never served (+87.5
//              discrimination on number drift).
//   refold   — the sentence makes no citable contact ANYWHERE in the fold, not
//              just its own slice: contamination from outside the situation
//              (+54.2 on cross-document splices).
//   witness  — the sentence stands on no source propositionally: groundSpans'
//              per-span verdict, the same witness gate the render binder reads
//              (+58.3 on cross-document splices, +29.2 on off-fold ones).
//
// What the weld does NOT catch, on the record: a polarity flip (negation) is
// invisible to every read-only organ measured (+1.1 best), and a figure swap is
// caught weakly (+22.5 composite). Those need a polarity-aware relation
// agreement and better claim-edge coverage respectively — organs to extend, not
// thresholds to tune. The weld ships what discriminates today; it does not
// pretend to more.
//
// Grain and action mirror evaSplice: the verdict is per SENTENCE, and the act is
// a strike — drop the drifted sentences, keep the welded rest. All clean →
// accept. Everything struck → reject (the caller holds the beat as a NUL rather
// than fold drift into the document). Striking, never rewriting: the weld has no
// model and writes no prose.

//   pool   the WHOLE fold the walk is drinking from — the "anywhere" the refold

//          wider fold (a one-slice walk), which degrades refold to the birth
//          gate's reach, never widens it.
//   doc    optional — the reading's own doc; lets the witness signal judge
//          propositionally (coref intact). Absent, the witness degrades to the
//          citation-holds gate against the slice, exactly as groundSpans does.
