// EO: SYN·REC(Field,Network → Lens, Composing,Making) — decision as relaxation
// relax — the decision as a network relaxing into an attractor, not a readout consulted
// (docs/decision-as-relaxation.md). Measuring, reading, and deciding are one event: the
// field's occupancy IS the input current, and the settling IS the choice. There is no step
// where the loop takes in p(next) and THEN consults it — the currents drive a winner-take-all
// relaxation with lateral inhibition (mutual repression — PU.1/GATA1) and self-excitation
// (commitment, memory), and the network falls into one stable configuration and is trapped
// there. Nothing chose; a feedback network relaxed into one of its stable states.
//
// The cadence is NOT scheduled. It emerges from an activator–consumer loop in the currents:
// introducing a figure leaves an undeveloped atom, which raises the develop current; the
// develop consumes it, which drops the develop current and re-enables introduce. Alternation
// is a relaxation oscillator, the way a central pattern generator walks — not a hand-written
// beat.
