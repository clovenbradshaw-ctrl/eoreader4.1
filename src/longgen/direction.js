// switch: the same predictor the reader uses, pointed at self instead of doc.

// THE WELD (docs/long-generation.md). Each accepted unit carries the floor's
// verdict; we read it back as the per-cursor STRAIN the structural prior reads
// (predict/structure.js): a unit that drifted (low bound fraction) raises strain,
// so the next draw leans toward REC/VOID — the engine that starts confabulating
// stops itself. strain = 1 − boundFraction; the structural prior does the rest.
