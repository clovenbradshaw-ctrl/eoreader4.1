// walk — the in-run multi-paragraph loop (docs/paragraph-at-a-time.md, the
// multi-paragraph-walk spec). v1 writes the whole design in one call: given a
// FOLD (ranked evidence spans), a DESIGN (ordered beats, or a { demand, outline }
// the walk carves once), and a MODEL, it emits paragraphs until the design is
// filled or the fold is spent. Each call to the model writes ONE paragraph — a
// CONTINUATION of the running document — bound and vetoed at claim grain after it
// is written. The only inputs that move from one call to the next are the two the
// walk is built on:
//
//   1. the prior paragraph, verbatim — the left-context the new paragraph opens on
//      (register/tense/diction inherited from real prose, never instructed);
//   2. a new part of the fold — the next beat's anchor span plus its strongest
//      UNCOVERED neighbours, so no span a prior paragraph consumed is re-served.
//
// Everything else is fixed or derived (seed, design, genre). Hold that invariant
// and the walk moves forward — five paragraphs cover five regions instead of
// restating one. Break it — re-serve covered spans, or drop the prior paragraph —
// and the two failure modes return: repetition, and a paragraph that opens cold.
//
//   SIG   select the beat's slice — its anchor span plus its fresh neighbours
//   render  build the continuation frame (facts above the line, heading, seed)
//   INS·CON  the model continues one paragraph from the seed; the binder cites it
//   EVA   check per sentence; splice off the ungrounded tail, regen below threshold
//   REC   fold the accepted paragraph into the running document
//
// maxBeats is the SEAM: v1 leaves it Infinity and writes the whole design; the
// deferred across-messages capacity sets it to write a bounded run now and resume
// the rest later, with no change to the body. The returned `state` is that seam's
// statistic — RETURNED by v1, consumed by nothing yet.
