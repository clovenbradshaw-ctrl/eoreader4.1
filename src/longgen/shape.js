// shape — the significance arc, not a canon (spec-planner.md §8).
//
// The temptation is a canon of response shapes — comparison goes two-sided,
// explanation goes general-then-instance — matched to the question and filled. That
// is McKeown's schemata, and it fights this system: a schema is a shape chosen from
// OUTSIDE the field and imposed on it, a void gate run backwards, and over a thin
// stub it supplies a balance the evidence cannot earn (the §3 structural lie on
// purpose).
//
// So no canon. ONE arc, derived: open by setting terms, develop, land. DEF or an
// orienting INS, then CON and EVA through the middle, then SYN to close. That is not
// a genre — it is the DEF→EVA→REC cycle, the significance row's intrinsic order, the
// shape any reading takes when it sets terms, tests them, and holds or restructures.
// The variety a canon would supply falls out of which operators the field offers; a
// contrast edge produces a comparison because the surfer keeps arresting on it.
//
// The arc is also the FLOOR on thin answers. An opening with no development and no
// close is just an opening — the honest one-sentence answer. The arc must land on
// something, so when there is nothing to land on it collapses to the term-setting
// atom and stops. Shape is what makes a long answer hold AND what makes a thin one
// stay short.
//
// shape.js does not navigate — it BIASES the navigation. It names the phase the
// coarse walk is in and a multiplicative bias over the alphabet that leans the
// direction draw toward that phase's operators; direction.js applies it before the
// temperature reach. The operator is still drawn, never dictated — a strong REC
// signal (the weld) overrides the develop bias, as it should.
