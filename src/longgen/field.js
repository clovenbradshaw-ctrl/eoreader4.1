// EO: SEG·DEF(Field,Atmosphere,Paradigm → Field, Unraveling,Clearing) — field read: turn boundaries
// field — the turn (REC) as a BOUNDARY in the generated field (docs/generation-by-field-reading.md).
//
// essay-backwards.md hit a wall: the fine cadence — when to turn — is not coaxable out
// of the move-predictor, and the lexical self-fold that licenses REC is a poor-man's
// proxy. The ingestion experiments (exp-0004) read a stream's boundaries as a density
// field: ATMOSPHERE = the local density departure (relEntropy), PARADIGM = the eigenbasis
// rotating (commutator), unioned and picked by the Born void (SEG), gated by the
// geography abstention (DEF). Generation is that act run forward, over the field
// the generation is itself laying down. This module reads the accepted atoms back as a
// field and returns, per cursor, whether it is a turn — the concrete first cut of
// spec-generation.md's "read self back through the perceiver".
//
// Causal by construction: at step k the units are the atoms accepted SO FAR, so the field
// is only ever the past. Pure but async (the embed call is async); the strain it returns
// is consumed synchronously by selfMoveLog.
