// projection collapsed its weights to ~0), and the loop, lacking a NUL, smeared it into
// hedged pseudo-prose. The honest move for present-but-uncohered ground is neither to hedge
// a shape the evidence cannot earn, nor to refuse (that is the answerability gate, a
// different failure — the wrong TYPE); it is NUL: hold the material, assert nothing.
//
// This is the ninth cell (core/voidnull.js `nul`) at the answer grain: read the ground's
// own scores against their Born noise-null; if essentially nothing clears it, the field is
// uncohered and the response is a single held atom — "I have these sources; they do not
// resolve into an answer" — with no sources cited, because there is nothing grounded to cite.

// Enough spans that "it does not cohere" is a measurement, not a cold start. Below this the
// walk proceeds normally — the NUL gate never fires on the small grounded answers.

// PARTICIPATION RATIO: treat the scores as amplitudes, and (Σw)² / Σw² is the effective
// number of items that actually contribute. Degenerate (one live, rest ~0) → ~1; a usable
// spread of N real scores → ~N. This is the concentration (inverse purity) of the normalized
// weight distribution — the same von-Neumann-style read the significance column runs, pointed
// at the ground. Below `min` effective items, nothing but one thing carries weight: uncohered.
