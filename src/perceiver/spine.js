// The significance spine — the document read at document scale (surfing-next.md §1).
//
// surfFold reasons over a LOCAL reach (±16 around one anchor). That is right for a
// pointed turn, but it starves the whole-document tasks: a "summarize" was handed an
// even STRIDE across the body (retrieve/structural.js), arbitrary lines that happen to
// fall on the stride, not the lines where the document actually turns. The spine fixes
// that with the surf's own scalar, read across the whole text: the cursors of highest
// BAYESIAN surprise — where the reading was rewritten, not where a token merely looked
// odd — are the document's turning points, and those are the skeleton a summary wants.
//
// BOUNDED. readingAt rebuilds its γ-prior from the log each call (O(events)), so reading
// every cursor of a long document is O(units · events). The spine samples on a STRIDE
// sized to a fixed budget, so the cost stays flat regardless of document length — a
// coarse skeleton, honest about its grain (`stride` is returned and logged). A short
// document is read in full (stride 1).
//
// PURE + memoised. The reading is a pure function of the (append-only) log, so the spine
// is computed at most once per document and cached by identity. No embedder, no model —
// it rides the same L3 reading the UI's reading mode and the surf already run.
