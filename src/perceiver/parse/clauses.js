// Clause segmentation — the §8 carve-limit fix (the "SEG-first rework" relations.js
// flags in its own comment). A sentence is cut into clause spans on coordinating /
// subordinating boundaries, each carrying its offset back into the sentence.
// parseRelations then runs the subject→verb→object scan PER CLAUSE, not once per
// sentence, so a MID-sentence subject becomes a clause-initial subject and its bond
// finally fires ("Gregor woke, and Grete opened the door" → two subjects, two bonds).
//
// Mechanical and defeasible by construction (the headVerb "better silence" stance):
// a boundary is a token from the seed ledger, not a parse. A WRONG split yields a
// MISSING edge, never a false one — fail toward silence. Each clause keeps the
// sentence's sentIdx downstream, so provenance and γ-decay are unchanged.

// The boundary markers — the home for the language-specific tokens, seeded and
// injectable (the same shape relations.js uses for copula/modifier/speech). A marker
// is matched lowercased; the clause ENDS at the marker and the next clause begins
// AFTER it (the subordinate/coordinate subject follows the connective, so the
// connective belongs to neither clause). Comma-led coordinators (", and ") keep the
// cut from firing on a bare "and" inside a noun phrase ("salt and pepper"). The set
// is HIGH-PRECISION on purpose: a marker that DOUBLES as a preposition or a verb
// particle ("looks AFTER", "BEFORE noon", "SINCE Monday", "UNTIL dawn") is left out —
// it would shred a phrasal verb's object off its verb. Likewise the ambiguous " that "
// / " as " / " for ". A missed split only loses an edge; a wrong one scatters offsets
// and breaks a real bond — silence is the cheaper failure.
