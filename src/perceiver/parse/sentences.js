// Sentence segmentation. Honours paragraph breaks.
// Drop-in replacement: any function (text) → string[].
//
// The boundary rule is a DEF — the established convention for where a sentence
// ends: a sentence-final mark (. ! ?) followed by space or end. The smartness is
// an EVA on each candidate '.': a period after a known ABBREVIATION (Mr, Mrs, Dr,
// St…) or a single capital INITIAL (J. Austen) is not a boundary — it abbreviates,
// so the cut is withheld. Without this, "Mr. Darcy" splits into "Mr." + "Darcy",
// and a one-token fragment is a junk unit that warps everything downstream (the
// meaning reader spikes on it, the graph mis-bonds). ! and ? are unambiguous and
// always cut.
//
// The abbreviation list itself lives in the conventions ledger (the home for the
// language-specific stuff), seeded as a DEF and learnable as a REC. The splitter
// holds none of its own: it takes an `isAbbreviation` predicate, defaulting to the
// ledger's seed so a standalone call still works. The pipeline hands it the live
// conventions, so a document's learned abbreviations flow straight in.
//
// HONEST SEAM — the boundary set is `.!?` only; `:` and `;` are not sentence ends.
// That is right for modern prose (a colon introduces a list or elaboration, not a
// new sentence), but WRONG for archaic text that uses the colon as its primary
// sentence separator. Measured on the KJV book of Genesis: 214 of 1458 units run
// over 40 words and the longest is 147 — whole genealogies welded into one unit
// because their verses end in `:`. This is not a local nuisance: the sentence is
// the reading UNIT everywhere downstream — the cursor steps per unit, the γ-mass /
// Bayesian surprise is computed per unit, the enacted loop breaks frames per unit,
// the coref decay window counts in units — so a 147-word unit silently degrades the
// surprise signal, the activation field, and the frame loop together, and it buries
// clause subjects deep enough that subject resolution (parse/relations.js) cannot
// reach them. The fix is a LEARNABLE boundary convention, and it is built:
// parse/boundaries.js runs the enacted DEF·EVA·REC loop over this very DEF, promoting
// `:`/`;` to a boundary for a document only when leaving them ignored fuses
// propositions into incoherent run-ons (meaning revising syntax). The promoted marks
// arrive here as `extraBoundaries`; modern prose, which fuses nothing, is unchanged.

// ── The HEADING boundary — a line break that ends a heading/label, not a wrapped line ──
//
// Web prose (and any extracted-from-HTML text) carries section headings and list labels
// on their own line with NO terminal punctuation: "Planned reboot", "External links",
// "Ryan Coogler reboot", "Places". The paragraph loop below collapses a single `\n` to a
// space, so such a line WELDS onto the sentence beneath it — "Ryan Coogler reboot" + "In
// March 2023, …Chris Carter" became one sentence, and the relation reader, finding two
// admitted names with the heading word "reboot" between them, minted the phantom edge
// "Ryan Coogler -> Chris Carter : reboot" that produced the wrong "Carter" answer. The
// heading is its own unit; the `\n` after it is a boundary.
//
// The discriminator from a hard-wrapped PROSE line (Project Gutenberg wraps mid-sentence
// at ~70 chars) is conjunctive and conservative — a real wrapped line fails it on length
// alone (it carries ten-plus words): the line is SHORT, ends in no sentence mark, does not
// trail off on a continuation word (a clause that wraps ends on "the"/"to"/"and"/a verb-
// like aux), and the next line opens a fresh capitalised sentence. Miss toward NOT cutting
// — a welded heading is a known, bounded harm; a shattered prose sentence is worse.
