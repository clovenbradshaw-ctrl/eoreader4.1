// an unsettled referent, thin coverage — that gap is a question addressed to the world. The
// proposer turns it into a query a confirmed user action (or an explicit auto mode) can run.
// Proposer-only by construction: this returns a proposal; the fetch happens elsewhere, behind
// a go-ahead. Null when the answer is well-grounded — a sound turn never reaches for the net.
