// retrieved spans keep mentioning but that never acts — and folds the results in as citable
// spans before the fold builds the reading (turn/stages.js, write/think.js).

  // retrieves from to confirm an interpretation: when the grounding doc is the model's own
  // notes (reafference) and the answer rests only on them, the engine fetches the source spans
  // on the claim's figures and re-checks. Null → no seeking, byte-identical.
  // `signal` is the turn's AbortSignal (the Stop button). Threaded into ctx so the `llm`
  // stage can hand it to the backend, which halts the decode and returns the partial answer;
  // an aborted `llm` then short-circuits the remaining stages. Null on a default turn.
  // `broadcastArc` arms the arc broadcast (turn/stages.js `prompt`, write/gravity.js): when
  // on, the surf's own dynamics — the focus's trajectory segmented at the RECs, turns
  // weighted by rewrite magnitude — ride into the talker's window as a plain-language arc
