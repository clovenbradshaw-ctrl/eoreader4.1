// go-ahead — automatically in `auto` mode, or via a `confirm(proposal)` callback in `confirm`
// mode — then fetch+admit the results (the caller's `webSearch`) and RE-RUN the turn with those
// sources added to the scope. Proposer-only is preserved: nothing is fetched without approval,
// and the engine itself never touches the network — `webSearch` does, outside the pipeline.
//
// `runTurnImpl` is injected (defaults to the real runTurn) so the orchestration is testable
// without a model or the network.

// and either VERIFY the first answer against it or RE-RUN the turn with the web sources in scope.
// Split out of runTurnWithWeb so a UI can render the first answer immediately, surface the
// proposal as its own confirmation step, and run THIS only on a go-ahead — instead of blocking
// the whole turn behind a popup. `query` overrides the proposal's query (the confirmation card
// lets the user sharpen it before searching); absent, the proposal's own query stands.
// Formulate a real SEARCH QUERY from the conversation — the fix for "web search is useless".
// The proposer hands over the raw chat question ("no there's a newer one", "who is making the
// new series as of 2026?"), which a search engine matches to nonsense (songs containing "no
// there's"; random 2026 TV series) because the SUBJECT lives earlier in the thread, never in
// the question. This rewrites the latest turn into a standalone query with references resolved
// (the thread's "new series" → "X-Files (2025 revival)").
//
// DISCOURSE-AWARE by construction. Before the model is ever consulted, the live turn is read
// against the DIALOGUE STATE (converse/dialogue-state.js): its operator (a pronoun, a stall like
// "tell me more", a redirect like "no, the musician"), the WARM REFERENT the conversation is on
// (the figure the cast holds), and the OPEN INTENT it left dangling. `resolveQuery` binds those
// in deterministically — so "who is making it?" becomes "…making it <the figure in focus>" even
// with NO model. That resolved query is (a) the answer when there is no model and (b) the discourse
// frame handed to the model when there is one, so the search chases the CONVERSATION's subject, not
// the latest sentence read in isolation. The answer firewall is preserved end to end: only the
// user's own words and GROUNDED referent labels ride (never the talker's claims — the audit's
// invented "Chris Carter, Frank Darabont" that once became the literal next search). Fully guarded:
