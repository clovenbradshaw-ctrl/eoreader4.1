// EO: EVA·DEF·REC(Field,Kind → Kind,Paradigm, Tracing,Dissecting,Composing) — task register (DEF·EVA·REC)
// The task register — the turn's task, read off the question as PHYSICS, governed
// by a DEF·EVA·REC loop. (docs/task-register.md)
//
// This used to be a regex cliff: the first pattern to match decided the task. Now the
// register is a MEASUREMENT with the same mechanics the route grain already runs
// (turn/meta-route.js) and the same defeasibility the conventions ledger gives every
// word-list (core/conventions/ledger.js):
//
//   · each task owns a BASIS — a term profile built from exemplar phrases, the
//     exemplar-centroid trick shape.js and meta-route.js run at their grains;
//   · the question's Born weight |⟨B|q⟩|² against each basis (surfer/salience.js) is
//     that task's raw pull;
//   · each weight is gated by a CROSSTALK NULL (core/voidnull.js deriveNull, ceiling of
//     what the OTHER tasks' exemplars score against this basis) — a task acts only when
//     the question aligns with it better than off-task speech does;
//   · the surviving currents settle in the winner-take-all relaxation the essay moves
//     settle in (longgen/relax.js), with `answer` as the RESTING DEFAULT — a pointed
//     lookup is not a signal, it is the ground state a real current must out-compete.
//
// The old regexes are still here, DEMOTED from cliff to SEED: when the measurement is
// alive a fired regex folds in at SEED weight (it informs, it does not decide — the
// same weight relax.js gives p(next)); when the measurement abstains (a terse question
// carries too little lexical signal to clear any null) the regex baseline rules,
// byte-identical to the old readTask. And every piece of held knowledge — each
// exemplar phrase AND each regex — is a CONVENTION on the DEF·EVA·REC loop, the same
// shape as the conventions ledger and the write-side grammar rules (write/eva.js):
//
//   DEF   hold an exemplar (this phrasing asks for a summary) — the tending surface
//         that replaces regex-patching: a misrouted phrasing is taught, not matched
//   EVA   test what carried a read against how the turn went → a hold reinforces
//         (support grows, strain relaxes), a break accrues strain
//   REC   revise: when strain overtakes support the convention is DEFEATED and leaves
//         the basis (or, for a regex, stops being consulted) — and a later run of
//         holds can reinstate it. A prior is a convention with support pre-baked, a
//         head start in confidence, not an exemption: a seed can lose.
//
// The register still sets the same three things it always did:
//
//   1. the prompt register — whether the summary degeneracy guard rides (summary
//      task only); a faithfulness instruction, NOT a length instruction.
//   2. the token ceiling (max_tokens) — the REAL length bound. There is no length
//      prescription in the prompt; the answer is as long as max_tokens allows.
//   3. the CUBE PLACEMENT — where on the EO cube the task operates: its DOMAIN (the
//      order of question / reading level — Existence / Structure / Interpretation),
//      its GRAIN (the Object axis — Ground / Figure / Pattern, "at what grain"), and
//      the SITE-FACE TERRAIN the two name ("where it lands"). A task is not
//      grain-blind: reading one without its grain is exactly the error the cube
//      forbids — a Figure fix applied to a Pattern problem (docs/cube.md). The
//      placement rides into the turn context (turn/stages.js spreads the register),
//      so every downstream stage knows the grain the question is asked at.
//
// The whole-document IDENTITY question is a summary, not a pointed lookup. "what is this
// document?", "what is this about", "what is this?" all ask the talker to say what the
// WHOLE document is — drawing the excerpts together — not to find a fact at one location.
// That distinction is now carried two ways at once: the identity phrasings sit in the
// summary BASIS while the pointed "what is this WORD" phrasings sit in the answer
// CONTRAST basis, so the crosstalk null holds them apart in the measurement; and the
// doc-noun regex keeps the same line as the seed for the terse forms the physics
// abstains on.

// Site-face TERRAIN — "where it lands" — derived from the cube authority below, never

//
//   answer  · a fact at ONE location — a concrete individual you fetch.   Existence × Figure  → Entity
//   summary · the WHOLE document read as one frame — not a fact to fetch. Interpretation × Pattern → Paradigm
//   list    · the SET of members as one regularity — enumeration.         Structure × Pattern → Network

// summary works the Pattern (the document-as-paradigm), explain works a Figure (one
// thing, through a Lens). list is Structure (level 2): the network of parts. answer is
// the Existence default (level 1): presence at a point. That a pointed lookup and a
