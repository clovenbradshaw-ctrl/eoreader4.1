// meta-route — the route read off the metacognition's own speech (docs/discourse-routing.md).
//
// The route grain was the last decision still made by string-matching the USER's words
// (intent.js regexes, artifactKindOf, COMPOSE_VERBS) or by forcing the model into a one-word
// vocabulary (transitionPrompt's CONTINUE/COMPOSE/GROUND/ISOLATE — JSON with fewer braces).
// This module performs the same collapse the loop already performed at the token, move, and
// field grains (docs/decision-as-relaxation.md): the model POINTS, in its own natural
// language, and a deterministic engine CONSTRUCTS the route from that speech.
//
// The metacognition is asked to talk plainly about the discourse — what the user is doing,
// what would satisfy them, what we don't know — with NO format contract at all. Its paragraph
// is then measured, not parsed:
//
//   · each route direction owns a BASIS — a term profile built from exemplar phrases, the
//     same exemplar-centroid trick shape.js runs at the answer-form grain;
//   · the paragraph's Born weight |⟨B|s⟩|² against each basis (surfer/salience.js — the same
//     projection the surfer rides) is that direction's raw pull;
//   · each weight is gated by a CROSSTALK NULL (deriveNull): the background is what the OTHER
//     directions' own exemplars score against this basis — the vocabulary the directions share
//     by chance. A direction acts only when the speech aligns with it more than off-direction
//     speech does; near-degenerate bases (essay vs poem share words) are nulled structurally;
//   · the surviving weights enter the same winner-take-all relaxation the essay moves settle
//     in (longgen/relax.js), with the carried stance as the INCUMBENT — a resting potential,
//     so continuation stays the default and a transition must out-compete it. The regex seeds
//     (isExplicitCompose, taskOf) fold in the same way: they inform, they do not decide.
//
// Why no meaning embedder here: the paraphrase problem lives in USER speech ("put together a
// few stanzas" defeats every poem regex). But the text measured here is MODEL speech, and a
// model describing that request says "the user wants a short poem" — the metacognition IS the
// semantic normalizer, so a lexical Born overlap in the engine's own term space suffices, and
// the route physics runs in the zero-download default instead of going dark until an organ
// warms. MiniLM keeps its territory where text nobody re-speaks is measured per-unit.
//
// Fallback contract (the same one routeStance already keeps): speech empty, model cold, or the
// paragraph coheres toward nothing (every weight under its null) → ABSTAIN → the caller's
// baseline (markers → continuation → fresh-regex-seed) rules, byte-identical to today.
