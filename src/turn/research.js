// Curiosity-guided research — multi-hop web research that follows the engine's own surprise.
// (docs/curiosity-research.md; the multi-hop sibling of the single-shot path in web.js.)
//
// The `auto` web path (app.js) fires ONE query, folds its results into the scope, and answers.
// That is enough to fill a single gap, but a real question often opens further questions: a
// fetched page names a person, a place, a reboot, a date the engine had never seen — and the
// honest next move is to go ask about THAT. Doing it blindly is shotgunning: fire a fan-out of
// follow-up queries on every term and drown the answer in tangential pages. This does the
// opposite. It expands exactly ONE thread per hop — the most SURPRISING one — and stops the
// moment surprise dries up.
//
// CURIOSITY IS NOT A NEW METRIC. It is the engine's ONE surprise (core/surprise.js,
// docs/spec-one-surprise.md) pointed at the web: D_KL(posterior ‖ prior) of a freshly fetched
// page against the γ-decayed profile of everything read so far. A page that only restates what
// we know moves belief by ~0 bits (low curiosity → a dead thread); a page that introduces a new
// figure, claim, or relation moves belief a finite positive amount (high curiosity → follow it).
// And the SAME computation hands back WHAT was surprising: `bayesBy`, the per-dimension KL
// contribution, names the atoms belief moved toward — those atoms ARE the next leads. So the
// search is steered by the measured gap, not by a keyword heuristic — active inference
// (docs/web-search.md "fire where expected information gain is highest"), run as a loop.
//
// Pure but for the injected `search` (and the surprise core it imports): the front-end map from
// page text into the surprise basis, the best-first frontier, the curiosity floor, and the hop
// trace are all testable with a fake search and a hand-advanced budget — no model, no network.

//            an exhausted-but-relevant page is fine; it is straying that ends the walk.
//   salienceRatio   the LEASH. Surprise pulls the walk OUTWARD (the most surprising lead is often the
//            most off-topic); saliency pulls it BACK toward the original question. Each hop's content
//            is scored for saliency to the FIXED topic frame (the seed query + what the seed page

//            saliency falls below `salienceRatio × the seed page's own saliency` has STRAYED TOO FAR
//            — it is dropped (not grounded, not expanded). Default 0.34: a thread a third as on-topic
//            as the seed is off the leash. `strayPatience` consecutive strays end the walk early.
//   strayPatience   how many consecutive off-leash hops to tolerate before stopping. Default 2.

//   searchOpts  extra options merged into every search call (e.g. { kind:'auto', fetchPages }).
//
// BEST-FIRST under two forces. EXPECTED CURIOSITY (the KL contribution that surfaced a lead) sets
// what to explore; SALIENCY (to the seed topic) leashes how far. The frontier priority blends them
// — a surprising lead found on an on-topic page out-ranks an equally surprising one found while
// already drifting — so the walk follows surprise WITHIN the orbit of the question. Each hop pops the
// best thread, fetches, then measures realized curiosity (against the running prior) AND realized
// saliency (against the fixed topic). On-topic pages join the ground and, if also novel, spawn deeper
// leads; off-leash pages are dropped. It ends when the budget is spent, the frontier empties, or a run
// of consecutive strays says the walk has wandered off the question — multiple hops, but never endless.
