// When the surf could not SETTLE on a figure at the peak — the stance-reserve guard, the
// field supported only a Ground move, so committing to a figure would be the confabulation
// — answering from the thin reading is the wrong move. The honest one is the same the
// engine already makes in `inquire` (write/think.js), brought in-turn: READ MORE of the
// document on the figure the reading kept circling, then fold again from the wider evidence.
// Attention is steered by the standing not-knowing, not by a fixed budget.
//
// Bounded to ONE extra pass (like revise's one rewrite) and dependency-injected — the
// retriever is passed in, so this stays a pure decision over (surf, spans) testable without
// the retrieve holon. Inert unless the surf actually under-settled and a fresh span is found.

// unsettled — the trigger. A pointed turn whose reading DID NOT SETTLE, with a figure still
// in view to read more about. The reading fails to settle in either of two measured ways:
//   · the stance RESERVED at the peak (a Ground-grain commit — no lens the field supported); or
//   · the coref field is DIFFUSE — `referential.concentrated === false`, the referent-ambiguous
//     measure: the passage does not settle WHICH figure it is about.
// The stance guard rarely fires on the 9-dim operator basis (it almost always finds a dominant
// lens), so the referential signal is what actually catches an unsettled pointed read on the
// default path. A summary legitimately rides the Ground grain and never re-reads, so this fires
// only on the `answer` task (or an untyped turn), and only when a focus figure exists to widen on.
