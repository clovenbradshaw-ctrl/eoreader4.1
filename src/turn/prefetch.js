// Speculative web prefetch — search the world WHILE the user is still typing, but
// keep nothing unless the turn proves it useful (docs/web-search.md, the quarantine
// discipline).
//
// This is the provenance gate applied to retrieval. A normal search is proposer-only:
// the turn measures a gap, the user gives a go-ahead, the engine fetches. That fetch
// costs a round-trip the user waits on. Speculative prefetch moves the fetch EARLIER —
// to the keystrokes before Enter — so the result is already warm when the turn asks for
// it. The cost is that we touched the network on a query the user had not yet committed
// to. So everything fetched here lands in a QUARANTINE cache, never in the answer scope:
// it is a provisional bond (low activation energy), not a Given. It hardens into a real
// source only when a turn TAKES it — i.e. the turn measured a gap and consumed this exact
// query. Every entry the turn never reaches is swept, having authored nothing.
//
// Standing authorization: this only ever runs behind web mode `auto`, where the user has
// already said "fetch on your own." In `off`/`confirm` it stays dormant — proactively
// sending typed text to a search engine before a go-ahead would break the proposer-only
// contract everywhere else in the engine.
//
// Pure but for the injected `search` and `now`: the cache logic (normalize, viability,
// LRU + TTL, take/prime/sweep) is testable with a fake search and a hand-advanced clock;
// the debounce and the DOM live in app.js, not here.

// Normalize a query for cache identity: lowercase, collapse whitespace, drop trailing
// punctuation. The chat-route proposal's query IS the question text (turn/propose.js), so a
// prefetch keyed on the typed box hits the submitted turn; a grounded gap that appends a
// figure simply misses and falls back to the network, which is correct.

// Worth a speculative hop? Long enough to be a real ask, short enough not to be a pasted
