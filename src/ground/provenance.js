// EO: EVA(Link,Network → Lens, Binding,Tracing) — per-proposition provenance (classifyProvenance)
// Per-proposition grounding provenance — veto on MEANING, not raw spans.
//
// A response is not one thing to accept or refuse whole. It is a sequence of PROPOSITIONS,
// and each can stand in a different relation to what was read:
//
//   VERBATIM    the proposition is lifted from a read span — the perceiver's own words.
//   GROUNDED    the proposition CORRESPONDS to a document proposition: the same figures
//               stand in the same relation. The meaning is witnessed, even if the wording
//               is the writer's own. (This is the test that matters — propositional
//               correspondence, NOT lexical span overlap. The audit's salad "Saving the
//               Appearances answer question" shares words with the title span yet asserts
//               no proposition the document holds, so it must NOT count as grounded.)
//   FABRICATED  the proposition corresponds to nothing read — pure enactor, no witness.
//
// EVERYTHING IS GROUNDED — even the fabricated. A proposition that nothing read witnesses is
// not free-floating: it stands on the model's own training data, and we name that ground the
// VOID. The void is a real ground — the ground of last resort — distinct from the source
// grounds (span/document) exactly because nothing outside the model witnesses it. So each
// proposition carries a `ground`: 'span' (verbatim), 'source' (grounded to the document), or
// 'void' (grounded only to the model's training). "Fabricated" is the OLD name for the same
// thing; it is retained for compatibility, but the honest reading is "grounded to the void."
// The point of naming the void is that the surface can RAISE it — say plainly "this rests on
// the model's training, nothing read" — instead of pretending an unwitnessed claim came from
// the page. A veto still acts per proposition — flag the void-grounded, let the witnessed
// ride — but it flags a KNOWN ground, not an absence.
//
// This is the provenance line (core/provenance) read at proposition grain: verbatim and
// grounded carry a PERCEIVER witness (they can anchor); void is ENACTOR-only (mine,
// grounded to training, unwitnessed by anything read). Embedder-free: figures match by
// label, relations by operator/verb; verbatim is the one place a literal span check is
// correct, because verbatim IS about the surface.
