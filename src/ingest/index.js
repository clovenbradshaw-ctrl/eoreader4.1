// The ingest holon: structured-data surface forms → canonical EO tuples.

// EOT (docs/eot-surface-syntax.md) is the producer-friendly front end — punctuation shapes a
// model already knows, lowered losslessly to EO events with operator recovery, anchor minting,
// site derivation, and provenance. RDF/OWL imports lower THROUGH this same surface (§10).
export { parseEOT, eotDoc } from './eot.js';
// The inverse: render a reading (the live engine log, or canonical tuples) BACK into EOT surface
// — every ready event read out in the same line syntax a model writes, deduped, no-ops dropped,
// only vocabulary-remap RECs surfaced; what EOT cannot express is reported, never silently lost.

// extracted (round-trippable canonical EoT) beside its prediction and surprise at every
// turning point — every predictive channel the engine has, run at the moment of ingest.
