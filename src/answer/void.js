// The typed absence — the response when the field holds no answer.

// (docs/answerability.md) Realises eoreader3's void typology in eoreader4's
// mechanics: rather than let the talker invent on an empty field, the route answers
// the absence directly and mechanically, with its receipt. The membrane holds —
// there is no talker here to be told a kind; the absence is rendered post-hoc from
// the measured verdict, the way a mechanical answerer renders a lookup. NUL holds
// the field; the response is a DEF to VOID.

import { fieldVerdict } from '../surfer/index.js';

// Render the measured verdict as plain prose. Each terrain renders as itself:
// never-set carries a scan receipt; elsewhere names the referent that is not here.

  if (v.kind === 'elsewhere' && v.term) return `"${v.term}" is not in this document.`;
  return `The document does not say — ${v.receipt}, and nothing here addresses that.`;
};

// A mechanical VOID answer, or null when there is an answer to give. Shape matches
// the other mechanical answerers — { route, text, sources } — plus a `void` stamp
// { kind, receipt, rode } for the audit. Cheap, deterministic, never warms the model.
