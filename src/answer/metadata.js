// The metadata answerer (docs/subjective-frame.md §3). A question about the document's
// own front matter — "who wrote this?", "when was it written?", "what's the title?" — is
// answered from doc.metadata as a DISTINCT FACT, mechanically, never warming the talker.
//
// This is the other half of restoring the recognition guard: the front matter no longer
// rides the content prompt (it would invite a talker to narrate a famous book from
// memory — model/prompt.js §3), but it stays ANSWERABLE. Title and author are facts the
// document carries about itself; a question that asks for one gets it, and a content
// question never sees it.
//
// Returns { route: 'metadata', text, sources } or null. Null when the question is not a
// front-matter question, OR when it is but the document carries no such fact — then the
// turn falls through to the ordinary path, where the subjective frame's absence clause
// ("I did not find that") is the honest answer.

// Intent groups: a matcher over the question and the ordered metadata keys it asks for
// (first present key wins), with a renderer that speaks the fact in plain prose. The keys
// mirror model/prompt.js's META_LABEL vocabulary, so any harvested front-matter key is
// reachable. Order matters — TITLE is read before the bare "what is this" so a pointed
// title question is not swallowed by the summary route upstream (it never reaches here
// anyway; the route tries this answerer before the talker).
