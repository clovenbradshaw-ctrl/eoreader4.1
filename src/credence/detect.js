// The changepoint detector (source-trajectory spec §6).
//
// Forgetting gives the slow part of the trajectory — the estimate drifts as the
// source drifts. This gives the SHARP part: a detector over each channel's
// observation stream so the system can NAME a regime boundary instead of only
// smearing through it. A source that was a seeker until a break and a bullshitter
// after it must read as exactly that, with the break dated (§6).
//
// The spec offers two implementations — Bayesian online changepoint detection on
// the run-length posterior, or a Page-Hinkley test on the residual between an
// observation and the current forecast. We take Page-Hinkley (in its clamped
// two-sided CUSUM form): exact arithmetic with no sampling, so the write-time
// decision to emit a SEG changepoint is deterministic and the audit replays it
// byte-for-byte (§7). The "run-length posterior collapse" the spec describes is
// what the reset-on-fire below enacts — evidence before the break stops
// accumulating into the new regime.
//
// The credence channels are BOUNDED (coherence/corroboration in [0,1], revision
// in [−1,1]), which lets the tolerance `delta` do the work a noise model would
// otherwise have to. Set it ABOVE the within-regime jitter and BELOW a real
// regime shift: then a stationary stream — erratic (a bullshitter) or tight (a
// seeker) alike — never accumulates, because every residual is clamped away
// before it can pile up, while a genuine mean shift far larger than `delta`
// accumulates fast and trips the threshold. This is what keeps a noisy-but-
// stationary source ONE regime instead of fragmenting it into phantom breaks.
// Two-sided: degradation (coherence drops) and reform (it climbs back) both fire.
