// EO: EVA·DEF(Lens,Link → Lens,Atmosphere, Tracing,Making) — browser grounding seam
// eo-gen — the generation-side seam the chat app still uses (browser).
//
// The ESSAY pipeline that used to live here is GONE (docs/deep-research-log.md):
// it asked a small model to write confident long prose it could not ground, and
// the audit showed the citations severed from the claims they were meant to
// carry. The reader's long output is now DEEP RESEARCH — the grounded projection
// over an append-only log (src/research/, loaded by the app as its own module) —
// where every claim is tethered to an exact span at a pinned address and the
// model is confined to one bind-checked phrasing call per section.
//
// What remains here is the one seam grounded answers still need in the browser:
// reflectAnswer (ground/reflect.js) — parse a settled answer BACK into EOT,
// compare each proposition with the reading's graph, judge every claim by the
// diversity of the sources that witness it. The app calls this after each
// grounded turn.

import { reflectAnswer } from '../ground/reflect.js';
// The per-SPAN provenance projection (ground/spans.js): classify every span of a settled
// answer as grounded to a SOURCE (with the precise line it came from — jumpable) or to the
// VOID (the model's own words). The app calls this per grounded turn so every span the reader
// hovers can say whether it was read or said, and where. Pure and DOM-free; the chat renders it.
// supportVerdict (ground/spans.js): the ANSWER-GRAIN bind-check the grounding badge reads —
// turns the per-span tally into an honest "matched" / "the model's own words" decision, so the
// chat path never badges a namesake-passage answer as grounded. Shared with the text organ.
// citationHolds (ground/spans.js): the per-citation honesty gate the chat's inline binder reads —
// below the verbatim floor a lexical passage match may stand as a citation only if the passage
// actually WITNESSES the claim, so a citation is never severed from the claim it carries.
