// sectionAnswer — mechanically impose section headings on a flat prose answer, by watching the
// ENTITY FIELD shift across its sentences. This is the same move detectStructure (app.dc.js) makes
// on a read document — a field-shift boundary detector with a mechanically-derived label — applied
// here to the answer the machine just wrote. The point of the metacognition-steers-the-shape change
// is that the talker writes grounded prose it is good at and never formats; the machine imposes the
// structure. Headings become an OUTPUT of the reading, not an instruction to the writer — so even a
// small model that will not emit "##" gets a sectioned answer.
//
// Dependency-light on purpose: the core is a PURE function over an already-parsed doc ({sentences,
// log}), so the reader can hand it the engine's own parse (this.E.parseText) with no heavy raw
// import graph. Labels are PLACEHOLDER-FIRST but EARNED: a segment is headed only when a discourse
// `lead` lands in it or a term is genuinely concentrated there; a summary/conclusion tail with no
// distinctive topic gets no heading and flows on as prose. The Born-salient figure per segment
// (surfer/metacognition.meaningfulness) is the documented upgrade path for richer labels.
