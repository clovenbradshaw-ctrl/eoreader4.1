This is the `deepReading` / `createDeepReader` engine in the `fold` holon
(`src/fold/deep-reading.js`). It is the second half of the continuity `idle.js` began.

## Two idle continuities, one firewall

`idle.js` (SPEC §15) argued that the chatbot posture — inert until prompted — is a gate held
shut, not the machine's nature: the surfer rides a field whether or not a question was asked,
and the §8 type law makes self-continuity safe. `idle.js` walks the **open set** (the voids)
against freshly ingested exafference — it waits for the world to close a standing question.

Deep reading is the other continuity. Instead of waiting on a void, the reading turns back on
the **document it already holds**: it measures where its own field is steepest and reflects
there. Both are legitimate for the same reason — every idle act is reafferent, and reafference
cannot witness (the firewall is the type, not a flag).

## The three moves

| move | what | from |
|---|---|---|
| **place of most interest** | the surfer's peak — where the reading's own field is steepest (Bayesian surprise), re-weighted by salience toward the live thread when one is active | `surfer/surf.js`, `surfer/salience.js` |
| **the fold** | `foldNote` at that peak — existence + structure + significance, every line carrying its source index | `fold/integral.js` |
| **the reflection** | the reading's own act of **evaluating** that fold against its frame; model-free by default (thinking needs no model), a model voice when one is injected | `write/think.js`, an injected `reflect` |

Nothing is authored. The peak is read off the physics; the fold integrates the reading there;
the reflection is the significance read voiced as an inner note (or a model's, when idle-compute
is spent on it).

## The epistemics — why it is safe to add to the graph

A reflection is **reafference** — the reading's own output, `fromEnactor`. By the §8 type law
(`core/provenance.js`) `canWitness(prov) === false`: it can organize attention and continuity,
but it **cannot witness anything as world**. It rides the graph at band **void** — held open,
an interpretation, never asserted as a firm fact — and `grounded:false`. Only a human's witness
act could ever promote it (`idle.js`'s `confirm`). So the loop can reflect freely without
laundering self-talk into record.

The loop is also **self-terminating** (`idle.js` I3): it reflects only where the place beats the
reach's own band (the significance is real, not the flat), **habituates** to places it has
already read (never re-reflects — the cure for rumination), and quiesces when no fresh place
beats the band. It never spins.

## The ontology — which of the nine operators a reflection is

**EVA** — Relate × Interpretation, *evaluate* (`core/operators.js`). A reflection is the reading
judging a particular (the folded place) against its established terms — exactly the enacted
loop's EVA (`significance-loop.md`), so it carries the same **verdict** (confirm | strain) and
**surprise**. It is tagged `register:'enacted'` (`enact/register.js`) — the reading's own act,
never a depicted perception.

`projectGraph` deliberately skips EVA (*"EVA, REC: live in the rules ledger, not in this
projection"*), so a reflection can **never** be mistaken for a depicted edge or fact. It surfaces
instead as a first-class **`eo:Reflection`** node in the reading substrate
(`fold/substrate.js`), beside the `eo:Tension` (a held EVA) and `eo:Reframing` (a located REC)
that already live there — carried at band void, witness `reafferent`, so the firewall is
explicit on the graph node itself.

## The event

`buildReflection` deposits one append-only event:

```
{ op: 'EVA', register: 'enacted', reflection: true, layer: 'reflection',
  cursor, sentIdx: cursor,        // the place of most interest — grounds/replays here
  focus, particular, verdict, surprise, body, sources,
  band: 'void', grounded: false,  // held open — an interpretation, never firm
  prov: fromEnactor('deep-reading'), door: 'enactor' }   // reafferent — canWitness === false
```

## The API

```js
import { deepReading, createDeepReader, readReflections } from '../fold/index.js';
import { surfFold } from '../surfer/index.js';

// one pass — surf to the place of most interest, fold it, reflect, append to the graph
const r = deepReading(doc, { surf: surfFold /*, reflect, thread */ });
//  → { peak, focus, verdict, surprise, body, sources, event, canWitness:false }

// the governed idle loop — the caller signals "not otherwise busy" via arrive()
const reader = createDeepReader({ doc, surf: surfFold });
const { reflections, quiesced } = reader.arrive({ anchor: 0 });
reader.canGround(reflections[0]);   // false — a reflection cannot ground itself (the firewall)

// read the reflections back off the log (they surface as eo:Reflection substrate nodes)
readReflections(doc);
```

`surf` and `reflect` are **injected** — the engine is deterministic, timer-free and DOM-free, so
it is testable and any product surface (the app's idle tick) is pure presentation over this
state. "Not otherwise busy" is the **caller's** signal (only it knows a turn is not in flight);
the engine exposes `arrive()` as the wake-on-idle entry, never a self-poll.

## Measured

On the opening scene of Kafka's *Metamorphosis* (18 sentences, 11 depicted facts over 4
figures), one idle pass surfaced three reflections at the reading's own surprise peaks
(sentences 13, 16, 17 — each a `strain` verdict), self-terminated after four passes, and:

- added **three** `eo:Reflection` nodes to the graph where idle had been silence;
- added **zero** depicted facts — `projectGraph` was byte-identical before and after (11 edges,
  4 figures);
- every reflection reafferent (`canWitness === false`), held void, and never projected as an
  edge.

The reading gets richer at exactly the places it found most interesting, and the record it can
witness is provably untouched.

## Into generation — the reflection handed to the writer, epistemics kept

The other half of the loop: when the walk is about to write from a source, it can *think
deeply first*. Before each beat, the reading surfs the **source** to its next place of most
interest (habituated — never the same place twice) and folds a reflection there; the
reflection rides into the beat prompt as the reader's **own reading**, and the writer composes
*with* the thought — while the grounder never grounds a claim on it.

The epistemics are enforced structurally, not by trust:

- **In the prompt** — the reflection is placed under `Reading note (your own reflection … — a
  reading, not a source to cite:)`, deliberately **NOT** under the excerpts header (`What I
  found reading it:`). The binder keys on the excerpts header to find citable spans, so a
  reflection below it is never a citable "fact." The prompt marking mirrors the event's own
  provenance.
- **In the grounding** — a reflection is an enacted EVA at the **enactor door** (`canWitness ===
  false`). `ground/provenance.js` separates propositions by door — `door !== 'enactor'` is
  witnessed existence/structure, `door === 'enactor'` is interpretation, never record. So the
  grounder *pulls apart what the model did in reading from the witnessed content* by
  construction.

```js
// walk with deep reading: surf the source, fold a reflection, hand it to the writer
walk({ …, deepRead: { source: parsedDoc, surf: surfFold /*, reflect: modelVoice */ } });
//   source  the parsed reading being written from
//   surf    injected surfer (surfFold) — kept an accessor so the walk stays decoupled
//   reflect OPTIONAL model voice (fold,ctx)→{body}; absent → the model-free inner note
```

`deepRead: null` ⇒ the prompt is byte-identical to the unwired walk (the rev-flag parity
contract). The place of most interest is habituated across beats, so each beat reflects on a
fresh surprise peak. Measured churn-detection payoff for the model-voiced form:
