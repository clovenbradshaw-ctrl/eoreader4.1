// The citation binder binds a claim to the passage it SHARES A REFERENT with, born from signal
// vs noise — not by clearing a fixed slice of lexical overlap. This pins the dolphins regression:
// a claim naming a specific figure (orca / bottlenose) the source names must CITE even though few
// of its words are the passage's, while a claim that shares only the ubiquitous subject
// ("dolphins") plus a coincidental word must NOT — even when its bare lexical overlap is higher.
